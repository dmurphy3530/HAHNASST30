SERUM ANGUILLAR ICHTHYOTOXIN, Serum Anguillar Ichthyotoxin, Eel Serum
COMPARE:  Great analogy exists between eel serum and the venom of the
Vipera.  Pelias, Lachesis. iac irregularities and a marked state of asystolia, we
may yet expect good results from this serum.  But to determine here the choice
of this remedy is not an easy matter.  While digitalis presents in its indications, the
well-known symptomatic trilogy:  arterial hypertension, oliguria and edema; the
serum of the eel seems better adapted to cases of hypertension and oliguria,
without edema.  We should bear in mind that the elective action of the eel's serum
is on the kidney, and I believe we can well assert that if digitalis is a cardiac, the
eel's serum is a renal remedy.  So far, at least, the clinical observations published seem
to confirm this distinction.  The serum of the eel has given very small results in attacks
of asystolia; but it has been very efficacious in cardiac uremia.  There, where digitalis is
powerless, the serum of the eel has put an end to the renal obstruction and produced
an abundant diuresis.  But its really specific indication seems to be for acute nephritis
a frigori (Jousset).  The experiments of Dr. Jousset have amply demonstrated the rapid
hematuria, albuminuria and oliguria caused by it.  In the presence of acute nephritis
with threatening uremia we should always think of this serum.  Very efficacious in
functional heart diseases.

COMPARE:  Phosphorus.  Carbon Tetrachloride as a remedy for Hook-worms,

Carbon tetrachloride is a vermifuge and vermicide of great potency, and has
shown itself to be the best vermifuge for the treatment of hookworm in a
country where the disease predominates.  '2. It gives little discomfort to the
patient, is palatable, required no preparation of the patient, and when pure is
apparently not toxic - all of which features are of advantage in a popular
campaign.  'W. G. Smillie, and S. B. Pessoa, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, also have
found carbon tetrachloride to be extremely efficient to removing
hookworms.  A single dose of 3 Cc. given to adults has been proved to
remove 95 per cent. of all the hookworms harbored.'
