</OBJECT>New Case File command (File menu, main screen) </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Use this command to create and open a new case file after you have already saved or closed a file or opened another case file.  The default file name selected by the “New” menu is “Untitled.cse”.  The new case file name will appear in the title bar at the top of the screen.  You will have an opportunity to change the file name the first time you use the Save Case File command.  If you have a file already open or have selected any symptoms, when you choose this option a dialog box will pop-up giving you a chance to save your current changes before opening the new file.  When the new file opens, all symptom selections are cleared.

To open an existing case file, use the Open Case File command.</p>

</OBJECT>Open Case File command (File menu, main screen) </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Use this command to open an existing case file.  If you have made changes in your Symptom List since last saving the case file a dialog box will pop-up allowing you to save your current changes before opening the case file.  A File Explorer window will pop up.  Below the File Explorer window is a box labeled “File Name” where the path of the selected file will appear.  You can click the down-arrow on the right of this box to bring up a list of recently-selected files; if you want to open one of these, select it in this list and its path will appear in the box.  To open a file not in the list, note that to the right of this box is another box with the text “Case Files (*.CSE)”.  If the file you want to open is not of the type “.CSE”, click the down-arrow on the right to display all file types “All Files (*.*)”.  Then navigate to the file you want to open and click on it; its name will appear in the “File Name” box.  Once the desired file has been selected, click the “Open” button (or double-click on its name in the File Explorer window).  If you change your mind, click the “Cancel” button.  When the case file is opened, all Symptom Lists will be updated to reflect the contents of the file.  The opened case file name will appear in the title bar at the top of the screen. </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Use this command to save the active case file under a new name.  Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant displays the Save As dialog box so you can name your document.  This is also a convenient way to make a copy of an existing case file.  The File Save As dialog box is similar to the File Open dialog box.  It contains a File Explorer window so you can navigate to the desired path for your new file.  In this window you can do anything you would do in a regular File Explorer window; for example select a folder, right-click on it, and select “New Folder” to create a folder below the selected folder.  Below this window is a box labeled “File Name” which initially contains the path and name of the currently-opened file.  If you want to save the file at the same path but under a different name, just edit the file name in this box.  If you want to change the path, navigate to the desired path in the File Explorer box; the current file name (minus the path) will appear in the “File Name” box (but the selected path will be used to save the new file).  As in saving at the same path, you can edit the file name if you want to change it.  Below the “File Name” box is another box labeled “Save As Type” with the text “Case Files (*.CSE)”.  If you want to save the file as a type other than “.CSE”, click the down-arrow on the right to display all file types “All Files (*.*)”, then edit the file type (“.CSE”) in the “File Name” box.  The complete path where the file will be saved will be a combination of the path selected in the File Explorer window and the name in the “File Name” box.  Click the “Save” button to create and save the new file.  If you change your mind, use the “Cancel” button to quit the operation.  The new file name will appear in the title bar at the top of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">You can use the Print command in the file menu of the main screen to print your selected Symptom List,  Questionnaire, Suggested Remedies, and Remedy Descriptions, or any combination of these, depending on which of these items are currently active (e.g. if the questionnaire contains entries, symptoms are selected, or the “Prescribe” button has been pressed).
