<h1>About Homeopathy </h1>
<p>The branch of medicine known as Homeopathy was invented by <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Samuel Hahnemann">
</OBJECT>Dr. Samuel Hahnemann of Germany (1755 - 1843). Homeopathy seeks to cure illnesses with the minimum necessary dose of medicine.  The key principle of Homeopathy is the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">

	<param name="Keyword" value="Potency Specifications">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Preparing Remedies">
</OBJECT>Homeopathic medicines are prepared by progressively diluting the original substance in alcohol, distilled water, or lactose, usually using 9, 99, or 999 parts of the diluting substance to one part of the original.  This dilution is then "succussed", which involves hitting the container of solution against a table, hand, etc. a number of times to mix the solution.  This process is repeated a number of times to obtain the desired potency.  Solutions prepared in this manner are called "Remedies", and are said to be "Potentized".  The strength is abbreviated by a number which indicates the number of times the remedy was diluted, and a Roman numberal X, C, or M indicates a 1/10, 1/100, or 1/1000 dilution at each stage.  Common dilutions are 6X, 6C, 12X, 12C, 30X, and 30C.  Surprisingly, the higher the number of dilutions, the stronger the remedy appears to act.  Potencies above 30X and 30C, and the "M" potencies, should only be used when prescribed by a physician.

<p>Homeopathic remedies are made from many different substances.  The majority of these are derived from various parts of plants.  Others come from animals or chemical sources.  Plants and soluble substances are dissolved in alcohol or distilled water, and are referred to as a

	<param name="Keyword" value="administration instructions">
</OBJECT>Homeopathic remedies are believed to be relatively safe, with few or no known side effects.  However for them to be effective, certain practices must be followed.  You should avoid fluoride, caffiene, and mint when taking Homeopathic remedies.  Even small amounts of fluoride can counteract Homeopathic remedies and make them useless.  For this reason, if your water contains fluoride, you should drink steam-distilled or properly filtered water (this is probably a good idea anyway).  Special toothpastes are available through health-food stores or in many grocery stores and pharmacies which do not contain mint or fluoride; common brands are Toms and Burts Bees.  Remedies should not be taken with food.  See the individual remedy containers and Homeopathic literature for specific instructions and dosage recommendations.

	<param name="Keyword" value="storage instructions">
</OBJECT>You will want to observe certain practices to maintain the potencies of your remedies.  They should be stored at room temperature, out of direct sunlight.  You should also keep them away from strong-smelling substances such as spices, and from electro-magnetic fields (motors, TV's, microwaves).  In addition, you should success them once per week.

<p>It is strongly recommended you obtain a good <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Materia Medica">
</OBJECT>Materia Medica to use in conjunction with this program.  These contain lists of remedies with their associated symptoms.  Many of them also contain a Repertory, which is an abbreviated list of symptoms with a cross-reference to remedies.  Two of the best Materia Medicas are "Pocket Manual of Materia Medica with Repertory" by William Boericke, M.D.. and "Lectures on Homeopathic Materia Medica" by James T. Kent, M.D.  It will also be very helpful to have a good medical dictionary.  Probably the best one for Homeopathy is the "Dictionary of Homeopathic Medical Terminology" by Jay Yasgur, RPh., M.Sc.  These books are available at many health-food stores or online.  One good source is Homeopathic Educational Services (homeopathic.com).  See the Bibliography section for mail-order addresses and additional titles.

	<param name="Keyword" value="potency recommendations">
</OBJECT>When starting to take a new remedy, you should always start with a lower potency.  In general, you will want to use a 6X or 6C, but you should consult a Materia Medica for specific dose recommendations, especially for the less common remedies.  You can then work up to higher potencies with time, if necessary.

<p>When taking Homeopathic remedies, as with any medicine, you should never try to "play doctor".  If your symptoms persist more than a few days, it is important to see a physician for proper diagnosis and treatment.  Many diseases may be contagious or can get worse with time, and require proper diagnosis by trained professionals.
