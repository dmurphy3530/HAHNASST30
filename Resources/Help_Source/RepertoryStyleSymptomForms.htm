</OBJECT>The "Repertory-Style" search button presents the Symptom List in a sequentially-detailed format, which makes it easier to search.  Instead of showing all symptoms in a single list, the symptoms are broken into phrases; those having identical phrases appear as a single item in the list.  For example, all symptoms beginning with the word "Stomach," appear as the single item "Stomach," in the list.  As with the "Symptoms" list on the main form, you can either scroll the list or begin typing the desired phrase in the box labeled "Enter search word(s) here:" to have the list scroll automatically to the phrase you typed (if it is in the list).  When you select a phrase it appears in the "Composite symptom phrase:" box.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Symptoms which require additional phrases to complete them are indicated by the "," following the phrase; when you click on them another list becomes visible with one or more additional phrases, and the yellow background moves to this list indicating it is the "active" list.  As you add phrases, they are appended to the "Composite symptom phrase:".  In the case where the next phrase is only used in one symptom (the next list that pops up contains only one phrase), it will behave as if you had selected the one phrase; if there are more phrases after the one phrase, the next list will pop up to allow you to select the next phrase (after the single phrase you didn't need to select); or if that is the final phrase, the entire symptom will appear in the "Composite symptom phrase:" box, just as if you had selected the final phrase.  If a symptom has no more phrases, there is no "," following the phrase; when you click on it, no additional list comes up, and you may change its weight by selecting a number (1 - 6) in the "Weight" box, and select it with the "Select" or "Must Use" buttons.  These work just like the "Weight" box and buttons on the main form; the "Select" button copies the symptom to the main form "Selected Symptoms" list and the "Must Use" button copies it to the "Must Box".</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to re-use a phrase(s) in another symptom, you can select a new phrase in the list that contains the next phrase after the phrase(s) you want to re-use (the list doesn't need to have the yellow background); the new symptom phrases will appear in the "Composite symptom phrase:" box.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that you can only select one symptom or phrase at a time on these forms (unlike the "Symptoms" list on the main form).  Clicking the "Clear Phrase" button closes all but the first phrase list so you can continue selecting phrases for another symptom.  Clicking the "Done" button closes the "Repertory-format Symptoms" form.</p>
