<h1>In Case Of Difficulty</h1>
<b>Problem:</b> 

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="problem fixes">
</OBJECT>Program generates a repeatable error message with a
number and a message that a certain function will not be available or
"Hahnemann's Assistant is exiting". </p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">This is usually caused by a missing file.  This could also be caused by a corrupted data file, or insufficient disk space.  Refer to the file list in the Readme.txt file and check that all files are present in the directory that contains the Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant executable.  If all files are present, check to see that you have a couple of Mbytes of free disk space for writing case files.  Although these files are relatively small, a large number of them could cause problems if disk space is limited.  Also, windows uses a portion of your hard disk for temporary swap space; if this is excessively limited, slow or erratic program execution can result.  If this does not remedy the problem and you are using a downloaded version, your data files may have been garbled in the download; you may want to try another download.  If these procedures do not remedy the problem, note down the number in the error messages and contact the author for assistance.</p>

<p><b>Problem:</b> </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Printouts are coming out the long way on the paper
(landscape mode).</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Click on the "Setup" button in the print dialog.  This is the box that pops up when you select the print option from the "File" menu.  Click on the "Portrait" option for paper orientation.  You do not need to print in "landscape" mode, as long lines are automatically wrapped. </p>
