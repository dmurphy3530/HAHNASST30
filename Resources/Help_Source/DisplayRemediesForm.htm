</OBJECT>The “Browse Remedies” button brings up a scrollable list of remedy names.  This list contains a name for every remedy in the database of Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant, and is used to select individual remedy Symptom Lists to view.  This list is in alphabetical order by remedy Latin names.  Scroll the list until the desired remedy is in view, then highlight the desired remedy name in the list; this enables the “Select” button, which will bring up a complete list of symptoms for that particular remedy.  Alternatively, you can double-click on the remedy name in the list.  See the section on the “Symptoms” list for a detailed discussion on using the scroll bars.  To “pop-down” the remedy list without selecting a remedy, click on the “Done” button.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you select a remedy to display, either by using the “Select” button or double-clicking the remedy name, the list of symptoms for that remedy pops-up.  This is the same list you can view from the Prescribe list.  The first line contains the remedy name, in the usual format.  This line may be followed by the word “COMPARE:”.  The COMPARE line lists the abbreviated names for one or more remedies which have at least some symptoms similar to that remedy; you may want to view these remedies to see if the symptoms may also provide a good “fit” for your case.  Following the optional COMPARE line is a list of symptoms for that remedy, in alphabetical order.  Symptoms are indented under main headings, to avoid repetition.  Symptoms which are especially prominent for that remedy are followed by a “*”.  If a remedy has symptoms which are almost “sure” indicators for it, these are followed by “**”.  A ">>>" in front of a symptom indicates that symptom is selected for the current case; note that the wording may differ from the case symptom, but the meaning will be synonymous.  Symptom lines which are too wide to fit on the screen are wrapped in this list; wrapped lines are indicated by a “+” at the beginning of the line.  If this list is too large to fit on the screen, use the scroll bars to view the rest of it.  See the section on the “Symptoms” list for a detailed discussion on using the scroll bars.</p>

<p>The “Remedy” display has a “Print” button, which works in a manner similar to that of the “Print” option on the File menu.  Clicking on the “Print” button brings up the Windows print dialog, which allows you to select the number of pages to print.  The remedy display will be printed in a format similar to that displayed on the screen.  Any lines too long to fit on the page are wrapped to the next line.  There is no “Print Preview” option for this display.</p>To “pop-down” the remedy display, click the “Done” button.</p>
