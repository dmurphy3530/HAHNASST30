<h1>Find Form</h1>
<p><img alt="FindForm" src="FindForm.bmp"<Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">

</OBJECT>Find button brings up a form with a text box labeled "Find what:" for you to enter in the word you wish to search for (see Figure 8).  To enter your text, click inside the box if the vertical flashing cursor is not already in it, and type the text.  When you type the first letter or number of your word, a list of words will pop-up below your letter.  This list contains all the words and numbers that you can search for in the Symptom List, in alphabetical order; the top word in this list will be the first word you can search for that begins with the letter you typed.  If you continue typing letters of your word, the list will adjust itself so that the first occurrence of the letters you typed so far is on its top line.  If you make a mistake, use the Backspace key to delete the last letter typed.  Alternatively, you can click the "Clear" key to the left of the word list to clear your entire word.  At any point in the process you may select a word from the list by clicking on it; if the word you want is not visible, use the scroll bar to the right of the list to scroll up or down until you see it.  If you click on a word in the list, it will replace the word you typed in the text box.  You can only search for words contained in the list; if you type in a word not in the list and try to search for it, a message will pop up informing you that the word you typed is not in the list.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that searches are not case-sensitive; all the words in the list begin with lower-case letters, but will search for matching words regardless of whether or not they are capitalized in the symptom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To the left of the word list is an option button labeled "Exact Match".  If this option is not selected (the button is blank), the search will look for words which match your search word, and also words which have extra letters at the end.  For example, a search for the word "pain" would search for "pain", "painful", "painful/soreness", "painfully", "painfulness", "painless", "painlessness", and "pains".  If the Exact Match option is selected, only the exact word you typed is searched for.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you have entered or selected your search word and set the desired "Exact Match" option, you are ready to begin the search.  There are four search buttons which allow you to specify how to search the Symptom List.  The Find First Button will find the first occurrence of your word in the Symptom List, regardless of where the list is currently positioned.  When it finds your word, it scrolls the Symptom List so that the symptom containing your word is visible, usually (but not always) on the top line.  The Find Next Button starts looking at the top line of the Symptom List currently displayed, and searches down for your word.  If it reaches the end of the list, it asks you if you want to continue your search at the top; click "Yes" to continue or "No" to end your search.  The Find Prev Button works exactly like the Find Next Button, except  it searches up in the Symptom List.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The search dialog box has a “modeless” property, which means it stays displayed even after the search is finished, and you may work with the main form below it while it is displayed.  This is done to allow you to continue your search for the same or another string.  After the first string is found, you can use the “Find Next” button to continue your search.  There is also a “Help” button which will bring up a brief help screen for the Search Dialog.  When you are done searching, you can close the form by clicking on the “Done” button or typing the <Esc> key.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Helpful hints:  When you first type a word in the box, the "Find First" and “Find All” buttons will be in dark text showing they are enabled.  After the first match is found, the "Find Next" button text becomes dark, showing it is enabled (if there is another symptom containing the word).  The “Find Prev” works in a similar manner.  Also, you can pop down the "Find" box if it gets in the way by clicking the “Done” button, and it will remember your last search word when you pop it back up.  If you want to search for a new word, you can use the "Clear" key to quickly clear the previous word from the box.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you are interested in all symptoms which contain your word, searching the list one symptom at a time could get rather tedious, especially for a common word like "pain".  You can bring up a list of all symptoms which contain your word by clicking the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Find All symptoms by word">
</OBJECT>Find All Button.  This button replaces the “Find” form with a list of all symptoms which contain your word.</p>
<p><img alt="FindAllForm" src="FindAllForm.bmp" /></p>
<p></p>

<p>Both the “Find” and “Find All” forms have "Select" and "Must Use" buttons and a "Weight" box just like the Symptom List on the Main Form.  You may select symptoms from the “Find” or “Find All” lists the same way you do with the Main Form Symptom List.  When you are finished selecting from the list, click the "Done" button at the bottom to pop it down.
