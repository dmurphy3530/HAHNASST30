</OBJECT>Several features have been added to version 3.0 to make finding symptoms and taking cases easier.
•	Version 3.0 uses a 64 bit compiler and is targeted for Windows 10 / 11.  It is being released as free, public-domain Open Source software.
•	The “File” handling menu options have been changed to match the file handling in OpenOffice Writer.
•	Buttons used to select Weight and Minimum Number have been replaced with drop-down boxes.
•	“Automatically Assign Weight” has been renamed “holistic” to make it more intuitive.
•	Weighting scheme, Minimum Number, Prescribing Schemes and Normalize have been moved out of the “Options” menu and grouped with their corresponding functions on the Main Form to make them easier to find and make currently-selected options easily visible.
•	The Grid Search function has been re-designed to make it more intuitive and to eliminate non-productive searches.  It now allows you to select words from a list of only words that would result in positive results, and only if they will narrow down the symptoms found.
•	A “Show Similar Symptoms” function has been added to suggest a list of symptoms similar to a selected symptom.
•	The “Set Weight” function has been modified to make it easier to change weights either before or after a symptom has been selected.
•	The Questionnaire pages have been implemented in a tabbed-page format to make them simpler to navigate.
•	The Questionnaire “Find Symptoms” feature has been expanded to include more synonyms for matching symptoms, and an option is provided to tailor the word search.</p>
