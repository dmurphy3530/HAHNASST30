<h1>Lists and Buttons</h1>
<h2> 	<Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="symptom list">
</OBJECT>The Symptom List</h2>

<p>The Symptom List contains an alphabetized list of symptoms, which correspond to the remedies in Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant’s remedy database.  Individual symptoms may point to more than one remedy, and each remedy corresponds to several symptoms.  You make up your case by selecting one or more symptoms from this list and optionally assigning each one a Symptom Weight of 1 - 6.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3> 	Using the Scroll Bars</h3>

<p>You use the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="scroll bars">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Search button">
</OBJECT>scroll bar and Search buttons to navigate through this list.  The scroll bar consists of a long rectangle with an arrow at each end.  Inside the long rectangle is a square moveable “knob”.  The position of this “knob” along the length of the scroll bar indicates the relative position of your view in the list.  Clicking on the arrow at either end of a scroll bar moves your view of the list in the direction of the arrow, unless it is already scrolled as far as it can go in that direction.  To move the list one line up or down, click once on the corresponding arrow on the scroll bar.  If you want to scroll several lines at a time, click and hold on the arrow until the desired portion comes into view.  To scroll one “page” at a time, click in the box area between the arrow and the movable scroll “knob” on the vertical scroll bar.  You can “warp” the list several pages at a time by clicking and holding in this box area.  To move long distances, click on the square “knob”, hold the left mouse button down, and “drag” the knob along the scroll bar.  The list view will scroll to the position proportional to the new knob position.</p>

<h3> 	<Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="symptom selection">
</OBJECT>Selecting Symptoms</h3>

<p>Once a symptom is in view, you highlight it by clicking anywhere in its line of text.  When you click a symptom, it appears in inverse video, with the text white and the background black (colors may vary depending on the preferences you have set).  If you want to “unhighlight” a symptom you previously highlighted, click on it a second time.  To highlight a group of symptoms, click on the first one in the group, then hold down the shift key and click on the last one in the group.  You can highlight more than one non-contiguous symptoms at once by holding the <CTRL> key down while you click on additional symptoms.  Highlighting symptoms gets them ready to copy to the “Must Use” or “Selected Symptoms” box.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To copy a highlighted symptom to the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Must Use symptom">
</OBJECT>“Must Use” box, click on the “Must Use” button.  If more than one symptom is highlighted, only the first one which is not already selected will be copied to the Must Use box.  Similarly, to copy one or more highlighted symptoms to the “Selected Symptoms” list, click on the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Select symptom">
</OBJECT>“Select” button.  The “Select” button copies all highlighted symptoms that have not been previously copied.  If you click on a highlighted symptom that is already in the “Must Use” box or “Select” list, a message box will pop-up explaining that you cannot “un-select” the symptom this way – you should use the appropriate “Delete” button; and the symptom will become highlighted again.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2> 	The “Must Use” Button and Box</h2>
<p>The <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Must Use box">
</OBJECT>"Must Use" box allows you to specify a symptom which must be associated with all remedies produced by the "Prescribe" button.  To copy a symptom to the “Must Use” list, click on the “Must Use” button.  If more than one symptom is highlighted, the first highlighted symptom which is not already selected will be copied.  If no symptoms are highlighted when you click this button, or if all highlighted symptoms are already selected, nothing will happen.  Note that the “Must Use” box can only contain one item.  If you click the “Must Use” button and there is already a symptom in the box, a dialog will pop up asking you if you want to move the current “Must Use” symptom to the “Selected Symptoms” list or delete it.  When you click the desired button on this dialog, the symptom moves out of the box and the new “Must Use” symptom replaces it.  If you elected to move it to the “Selected Symptoms” list, it is inserted into that list in alpha-numeric order; it will remain highlighted when scrolled into view in the “Symptoms” list.  If you elected to delete it, it will not be highlighted when scrolled into view in the “Symptoms” list.</p>

<p>	Keys:		ALT+M</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2> 	The “Select” Button and “Selected Symptoms” List</h2>

<p>Clicking on the “Select” button copies all highlighted symptoms in the Symptoms list which are not already in the “Must Use” box or “Selected Symptoms” list to the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Selected Symptoms list">
</OBJECT>“Selected Symptoms” list.  If no symptoms are highlighted when you click this button, or if all highlighted symptoms are already selected, nothing will happen.  Symptoms copied into the "Selected Symptoms" list are inserted in alphabetical order (ignoring the preceding weight number).</p>
<p>Shortcut</p>
<p>	Keys:		ALT+S</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2> 	Symptom Weights</h2>

<p>Items in the “Must Use” box and the “Selected Symptoms” list have a number in front of the symptom; this is the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="symptom weight">
</OBJECT>Symptom Weight, which is used in ranking the importance of the symptom and its associated remedy or remedies.  Symptom weight can range from 1 – 6.  When a symptom is first selected, this number will be the number in the “Weight” box (initially set to 1).  To change this number, click the “?” on the right side of the “Weight” box and select the desired number from the drop-down list.  When a symptom is first selected, it remains highlighted in the "Must Use" box or "Selected Symptoms" list, so you will not need to click on it to change the weight.  Also, clicking on a symptom in the "Selected Symptoms" list un-highlights a symptom in the "Must Use" box, and vice versa.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Symptoms in the “Selected Symptoms” list are arranged in alpha-numeric order.  Because the Symptom Weight number appears first, they will be sorted in order by number, then alphabetically; for this reason the symptom will likely move in the list when you change the Symptom Weight.  Note that if the “Selected Symptoms” list is not displaying the portion where your symptom will appear when you select it, the list scrolls so this portion is visible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>See the section on the “Weight” box below for a detailed discussion on assigning symptom weights.</p>

<h2> 	The “Find” and "Grid" Buttons</h2<Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Find button">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Grid search button">
</OBJECT>“Find” and "Grid" buttons are located to the right of the “Must Use” button, under the “Symptoms” list.  See the section on the “Symptoms” list for a detailed discussion on using these buttons.</p>
<p>Shortcut</p>
<p>	Keys:		(Find) ALT+F</p>
<p>			(Grid) ALT+G</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2> 	The “Weight” Box</h2>

<p>The box in the “Set Weight” section is used for assigning Symptom Weights.  To change this number, click the “?” on the right side of the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Weight box">
</OBJECT>“Weight” box and select the desired number from the drop-down list (numbers 1 – 6).</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you add symptoms to the “Must Use” box or “Selected Symptoms” list, they will initially be assigned the weight number in this box.  This provides an easy way to set a number of symptoms to the same weight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you need to change <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Symptom weight, setting">
</OBJECT>symptom weight after a symptom is already in the “Must Use” box or the “Selected Symptoms” list, click on the symptom to select it, then select the desired weight in the “Weight” box.  The “Must Use” box and “Select” list are linked together such that only one item can be highlighted at one time; if you click on an item in the “Selected Symptoms” list while the “Must Use” item is highlighted, the “Must Use” highlight goes away and “Moves” to the symptom you clicked on.  A similar action takes place when you click on a symptom in the “Must Use” box.  If an item in the “Selected Symptoms” list is highlighted and you click on another item, the highlight “moves” to the new item.  Once the desired symptom is selected, set the number in the “weight” box to the desired number (1 – 6) to change the weight.  When changing the weight of a symptom in the “Selected Symptoms” list, it will likely move it to a different position because the list is an alpha-numeric order.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2> 	The “Delete Must” Button</h2>

<p>Directly below the “Must Use” box is the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Delete Muse Use symptom">
</OBJECT>“Delete Must” button.  Clicking on this button will allow you to delete an item in the “Must Use” box.  If there is not a symptom in the “Must Use” box, this button is “grayed out”, indicating it is inactive.  The “Must Use” symptom does not have to be highlighted to delete it.  When you click this button, a box will pop-up with the question, “Move current must-use selection to selected list?”  Clicking on “Yes” will move the symptom out of the “Must Use” box, and it will be inserted into the “Selected Symptoms” list.  Clicking “No” deletes the symptom from the “Must Use” box; the symptom will no longer be considered in prescribing, and it will be un-highlighted if you move it into view in the “Symptoms” list.  It is possible to re-select symptoms that have been deleted.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2> 	The “Delete Sel” Button</h2>

<p>The <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Delete Selected symptom">
</OBJECT>“Delete Sel” button below the “Selected Symptoms” list is used to delete items from that list.  Because the list can contain more than one item, you must highlight the item by clicking on it to indicate which symptom you want to delete before using this button (if you don't select any symptom, nothing will happen when you click the button).  This may require scrolling the list to bring the desired item into view.  As with the “Delete Must” button, this button will be inactive (grayed out) if there are no items in the “Selected Symptoms” list.  Deleted symptoms will no longer be considered in prescribing, and will be un-highlighted if you move them into view in the “Symptom” list.  It is possible to re-select symptoms that have been deleted.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2> 	The “Prescribe” Button</h2>

<p>When you are finished selecting your symptoms, use the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Prescribe button">
</OBJECT>“Prescribe” button to suggest a list of remedies.  There must be at least one symptom selected for this button to be enabled; the “Prescribe” button will be “grayed out”, indicating it is inactive, if neither the “Must Use” box nor the “Selected Symptoms” list contain any items.  When you click on the “Prescribe” button, Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant searches its database for all remedies associated with your selected symptoms.  It then assigns them a number, based on the number of symptoms selected for that remedy, your prescribing scheme, the symptom weights you assigned, and optionally the remedy weights.  See the section on the Options Menu commands for a detailed discussion of prescribing schemes.  If you selected a “Minimum Number” greater than “1”, remedies will only be displayed if they are associated with at least that number of symptoms in your case.  If you selected a “Must Use” symptom, only remedies which contain that symptom will be displayed.  Remedies are displayed in order of highest ranking to lowest; this means that the remedy which Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant predicts most likely to succeed will appear at the top of the list.  The remedy list is limited to 1000 remedies.</p>
