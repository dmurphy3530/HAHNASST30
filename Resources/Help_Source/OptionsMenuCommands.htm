	<param name="Keyword" value="Options Menu">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Set Preferences">
</OBJECT>Options Menu brings up the “Set Preferences” form which allows you to specify printer and screen fonts as well as text foreground and background (surrounding) color.  You also have the option to set whether to show the toolbar, status bar, and ToolTips.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Click in the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Printer font selection">
</OBJECT>Printer Font check box to bring up the Windows font dialog and specify the font for printing.  To select a font, you can either scroll the Font list and click on the font name you want, or type the name in the box under the "Font:" label.  As you begin to type, the list will scroll to show font names beginning with the letters you have already typed, as an aid to selection.  After you select a font, an example will appear in the "Sample" box.  Use the “Style” box to select the desired style (normally you would want “Regular”).  To the right of the "Font style" box is a box labeled "Size:".  Use this to select the point size from those available for the font.  Take care in selecting sizes; too small a size may be unreadable, while too large a size will not fit on the page.  If the font you choose is a TrueType font, a message will appear at the bottom of the pop-up.  The “Effects” box lets you choose either strikeout or underline.  The "Script" box allows you to select a script appropriate to your language.  When you are done setting your font, click the "OK" button to continue with your changes; the first box in the “Set Preferences” form will now show the message “Printer Sample” in the font you selected.  If you click the "Cancel" button, you will revert to your old printer font.  Note that the font you chose will not actually take effect until you click the "Apply" button on the "Set Preferences" form.</p>
<p></p>

<p>You can change the font used for the letters displayed on your screen (within the program) by clicking the Screen Font check box.  This will bring up the Windows font dialog.  See the description of the "Printer Font check box" above for instructions for using the font dialog.  If you click the “OK” button, the second box in the “Set Preferences” form will show the message “Screen Sample” in the font you selected.  As with the Printer Font, the font you chose will not take effect until you click the “Apply” button on the “Set Preferences” form.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Clicking the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Text Background Color selection">
</OBJECT>Text Background Color check box brings up the Windows color dialog.  This dialog presents the colors available on your computer in the "Basic colors:" section.  To select one of these colors, click on its square.  If you want to define a color which doesn't appear in the "Basic colors" or “Custom colors” sections, click the "Define Custom Colors >>" button.  This adds a section to the right of the color dialog which will allow you to create a custom color.  The color you create appears in the "Color|Solid" box.  You can set up your custom color by moving the cursors in the color boxes at the top, by typing in the numbers 0 - 255 in the Hue, Sat., and Lum. boxes, or by typing in the numbers 0 - 255 in the Red, Green, and Blue boxes.  To move one of the cursors, click on the square or the column at the position you want, and the cursor will move where you point.  Moving the cursor in the large square box right or left affects the hue value.  Moving it up and down affects the Sat. value.  Moving the cursor for the column to the right of this box affects the Lum. value.  If you prefer to specify colors by the amount of red, green, and blue in the color, type the appropriate numbers in the Red, Green, and Blue boxes.  A value of 0 will give none of a color, while a value of 255 gives the maximum amount of the color.  When you are done setting up your custom color, click the "Add to Custom Colors" button; your new color will appear in the first unused box in the "Custom colors:" section.  To use a custom color, click on its box.  When you are done selecting your color, click the "OK" button to continue with your changes, or the "Cancel" button to revert to your old color.  The color you chose will appear in the "SAMPLE" box, but will not actually take effect until you click the "Apply" button on the "Set Preferences" form.  Note that this setting only affects the background color of boxes and lists containing text; the background color of forms is controlled by the Windows setting.</p>

<p>To change the color of the letters on your screen, click the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Text Foreground Color selection">
</OBJECT>Text Foreground Color check box.  This will bring up the Windows color dialog.  See the description of the "Text Background Color check box" above for instructions on using the color dialog.  You should take care when choosing your screen colors that the foreground and background colors are not so similar (or identical) to each other that the text on the screen will not be readable.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Use the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Restore Font and Color">
</OBJECT>Restore Initial Settings check box to return your screen colors and printer and screen fonts to those when you originally installed Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant.   When you click this box, a dialog will pop-up asking you if you are sure you want to restore the initial settings.  To restore the settings, click "Yes"; to cancel your action, click "No".  If you click "Yes", the initial settings for screen and printer font and screen background and foreground colors will be displayed in the two boxes.  As with the font settings, these changes will not actually take effect until you click the “Apply” button on the “Set Preferences” form.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Once you have set up your fonts and/or colors, you may still discard your selections by clicking the "Cancel" button on the "Set Preferences" form.  If you want to save your preferences, click the Apply button; this will immediately apply your new settings, pop-down the "Set Preferences" form, and store the preferences to the Windows Registry.  To see font and color modifications, you will need to restart Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The bottom portion of the "Set Preferences" dialog allows you to adjust helpful features to your preferences.  Use the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Show Toolbar">
</OBJECT>"Show Toolbar" option to display or hide the Toolbar, which contains buttons for some of the most common commands in Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant, such as File Open.  The <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Show Status Bar">
</OBJECT>"Show Status Bar" option displays a bar at the bottom of the main screen which contains short helpful messages relating to the item the mouse cursor is resting on.  Use the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">

</OBJECT>"Show Tooltips" option to allow ToolTips to be displayed.  ToolTips are the short descriptions which pop-up after a couple of seconds when you move the mouse over a button, box, or list.</p>
<p></p>

<p>When you are finished setting your preferences, click the “Apply” button to have them take effect.  The Toolbar, Status Bar, and ToolTips settings will take effect immediately.  As mentioned above, the font and color settings will require re-starting Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant before they take effect.  All preference settings will remain in effect every time you run the program, until you change them.  If you decide not to use the preferences you have selected, click the “Cancel” button.</p>
