<h1> 	The "Grid Search" Button</h1>
<p><img alt="GridSearchForm" src="GridSearch<Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Grid search for symptom by words">
	<param name="Keyword" value="symptom search by grid">
</OBJECT>"Grid" below the "Find" button brings up the "Power Grid Search" form (see Figure 10).  This form allows you to specify more than one search word.  It functions in a manner similar to the "Find" form, but allows you to logically AND and OR search words together.  You enter words similar to the way you do in the "Find" form.  First click on a text box to select it, then begin typing letters for the word you want to add to your search.  A list pops up below which contains only words that would result in selecting one or more symptoms, so no time is wasted entering words that would not find anything.  To “select” the word, you need to click on it in the list, even if you have already typed the complete word; this prevents accidentally selecting words which are contained in other words, for example “ear” is contained in “hear”.   Words entered in the same row are ANDed together; for example, if a row contained the words "pain" and "stomach", only the symptoms which contain both "pain" AND "stomach" would satisfy the search.  As you add words, the next box to the right (if there is one) is enabled for you to add the next word; but if the result of a row of ANDed words would allow only a single symptom to be selected, even though less than 4 words are entered, the text box to the right is not enabled as it would be a waste of time to add more words.  Words or groups of words entered in different rows are ORed together; if the words in the previous example were entered in separate rows, symptoms which contain either "pain" OR "stomach" would satisfy the search.  This means that what is ORed is the result of the AND in each row.  ORing words or groups of words allows you to search for several groups of symptoms at the same time.  Since you select the words from the list, there is no “exact match” option.  The rest of the buttons at the top of the screen have the same functions as the corresponding buttons in the "Find" form.  The "Clear All" button can be used to conveniently clear all your words. </p>

	<param name="Keyword" value="Power Grid search box">
</OBJECT>Power Grid Search dialog box has a “modeless” property, which means it stays displayed even after the search is finished, and you may work with the main form below it while it is displayed.  This is done to allow you to continue your search for the same or another string.  After the first string is found, you can use the “Find Next” button to continue your search.  There is also a “Help” button which will bring up a brief help screen for the Power Grid Search Dialog.  When you are done searching, you can un-display the dialog by clicking on its “Cancel” button or typing the <Esc> key.</p>

<p>Helpful hints:  When you first type a word or words in any box(s), the "Find First" button will be the "default" button (denoted by the black line which will surround it); you can select this button by typing the <Enter> key.  After the first match is found, the "Find Next" button becomes the default.  This allows you to do a sequential search without having to use the mouse.  Also, you can pop down the "Power Grid Search" box if it gets in the way, and it will remember your last search words when you pop it back up.  If you want to search for new words, you can use the "Clear" key to quickly clear the previous word(s) from the box.  The <tab> key will move the cursor to the next text box, or the first box of the row below if it is in the last (or last enabled) box of a row.  While you can use the Power Grid Search to search for single words just as you use the "Find" dialog box, it may be less convenient to use due to its large size.
