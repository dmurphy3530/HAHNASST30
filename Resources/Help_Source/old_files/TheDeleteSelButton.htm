<h1>The Delete Sel Button</h1>
The Delete Sel button below the <a
href="TheSelectButtonAndSelectedSymptomsList.htm">Selected Symptoms</a> list is
used to delete items from that list. Because the list can contain more than one
item, you must highlight the item by clicking on it to indicate which symptom
you want to delete before using this button. This may require scrolling the
list to bring the desired item into view. As with the <a
href="TheDeleteMustButton.htm">Delete Must</a> button, this button will be
inactive (grayed out) if there are no items in the Selected Symptoms list.
Deleted symptoms will no longer be considered in prescribing, and will be
un-highlighted if you move them into view in the <a
href="TheSymptomList.htm">Symptom</a> list. It is possible to re-select
symptoms that have been deleted. </body>
