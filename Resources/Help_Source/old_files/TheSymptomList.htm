<H1>The Symptom List</H1>

The Symptom List contains an alphabetized list of symptoms, which correspond to the remedies in Dr. Hahnemanns Assistants remedy database.  Individual symptoms may point to more than one remedy, and each remedy corresponds to several symptoms.  You make up your case by selecting one or more symptom from this list and optionally assigning each one a Symptom Weight of 1 - 6.


<H2>Using the Scroll Bar</H2>

You use the scroll bar and Search buttons to navigate through this list.  The scroll bar consists of a long rectangle with an arrow at each end.  Inside the long rectangle is a square moveable knob.  The position of this knob along the length of the scroll bar indicates the relative position of your view in the list.  Clicking on the arrow at either end of a scroll bar moves your view of the list in the direction of the arrow, unless it is already scrolled as far as it can go in that direction.  To move the list one line up or down, click once on the corresponding arrow on the scroll bar.  If you want to scroll several lines at a time, click and hold on the arrow until the desired portion comes into view.  To scroll one page at a time, click in the box area between the arrow and the moveable scroll knob on the vertical scroll bar.  You can warp the list several pages at a time by clicking and holding in this box area.  To move long distances, click on the square knob, hold the left mouse button down, and drag the knob along the scroll bar.  The list view will scroll to the position proportional to the new knob position.
