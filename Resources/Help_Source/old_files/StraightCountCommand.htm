<h1>Straight Count command (Options menu)</h1>
The Straight Count prescribing scheme uses a simple count of symptom hits per
remedy when making selections. However, the <a
href="TheWeightButtons.htm">symptom weights</a> you assign (or which the
program assigns if you are using the <a
href="AutomaticallyAssignWeightCommand.htm">Automatically Assign Weight</a>
option) are used when adding up the symptoms for each remedy. This means that
if you assign a case weight of 4 to a symptom, it will count as 4 hits for its
remedy. To avoid using any weighting factor, turn off the "Automatically Assign
Weight" option and leave the symptom weights at a value of "1" (the value the
program initially gives them when you select symptoms).
