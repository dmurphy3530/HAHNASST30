<h1>The "Questionnaire" Button and Pages</h1>
To facilitate entering and archiving cases, Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant provides
a case "Questionnaire" which can be used to enter and track patient cases. This
questionnaire consists of 7 screens or pages, which allow entry of most items
commonly contained in a patient case history. <a name="L607"
id="L607"></a>Pages have tabs, which allow you to easily navigate between
pages. The first four pages contain specific symptom-related questions; this
group of pages is used repeatedly for each symptom, for as many symptoms as
necessary to describe the case. The last three pages contain more general
questions relating to the patient. The data in the questionnaire may be saved
to and read back from a file, so that the case may be archived and updated.
This also allows patients to enter their own cases and email or upload copies
to the physician. You can also print the questionnaire case. After the
questionnaire is filled out, you can optionally have it present a list of
symptoms that are likely to fit the answers, as a start on your Symptom List. 

<p></p>

<p>To bring up the Questionnaire, click on the "Questionnaire" button on above
the "Symptoms" list. The first page of the questionnaire will come up. This
page has boxes for you to enter the patient name, the current date, and the
patient date of birth. As you enter text, you can use the <TAB>&lt;TAB&gt; key
to move the cursor to the next field or <SHIFT><TAB>&lt;SHIFT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; to
move to the previous field; you can also click in a field. There is no
restriction on the text you enter in the boxes. Some questions have check boxes
that you click to give an answer. You can only check one of these per question;
if another check box was already checked, the check will move to the box you
clicked, radio-button style. You are not required to answer all the questions,
but the more you answer, the more complete your case will be. </p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L63" id="L63"></a>When you have completed a page, click on the
"Continue" button at the bottom of the page to bring up the next one. The title
at the top of the page tells you which page and symptom number you are
currently on. Continue filling out the forms for the symptom you specified on
Page 1. <a name="L613" id="L613"></a>When you finish page 4, you have the
option to add another symptom by clicking the Add Symptom button. This button
will return you to page 1, but the page will be blank, so you can begin
entering your next symptom; also, the title at the top of the page will
indicate the new symptom number. When you finish entering your last symptom,
click the "Continue" button on page 4; this will bring up page 5, which allows
you to enter more general information such as patient likes and dislikes,
attributes, etc. <a name="L617" id="L617"></a>When you are done with page 7,
you may have Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant try to match your questionnaire answers
to symptoms from its symptom database by clicking the Find Symptom button. This
will bring up the "<a href="FindAllForm.htm">Find All</a>" list, which will
contain all symptoms which may provide a match to your questionnaire answers.
The cursor will change into an hourglass as this form comes up; be patient, as
finding all the symptoms may take several minutes. In front of each symptom
will be a group of numbers which indicate the first question used to pick the
symptom. The first number is the page, followed by a "/" and the symptom
number. The following number is the question on the page, numbering
consecutively from the top as question #1. Following this is the symptom weight
and description. You select symptoms and assign weights just like you do in the
main form. To view the portion of a symptom which extends past the right side
of the list, click the symptom; the complete symptom will appear in the box
above the Symptom List. When you are done selecting symptoms, click the "Done"
button below the list. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Questionnaires are stored in files, similar to the manner in which cases are
stored. The default extension for questionnaire files is ".QUE". To load and
save questionnaire files, you can use the "File" menu at the top of any
questionnaire page. These options are identical to the <a
href="NewCaseFileCommand.htm">Questionnaire File options</a> available in the
main form File menu. To archive individual cases, you may want to use a
descriptive file name such as the patient's name, followed by a number or date.
When you are ready to add to the case, you can open the latest questionnaire
file for the patient, make your updates to the questionnaire, and save the file
with the same name but a new number or date; in this way you will have a
running record for each patient.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L611" id="L611"></a>The main questionnaire page also has Print and
Print Preview menu items. These bring up dialogs similar to the ones on the
main form, which allow you to preview your printout, select and set up your
printer, and print the questionnaire. The "Print Questionnaire" option will
print out a formatted report of the questionnaire, displaying the questions
with your answers. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The questionnaire pages contain several buttons and a list box at the bottom
of the page which make it easy to navigate between questionnaire pages and
symptoms. Note that some buttons are not included on all pages, as they would
not be appropriate. The <a name="L73" id="L73"></a>"Next" and <a name="L69"
id="L69"></a>"Prev." buttons under the word "Symptom" allow you to go to the
next and previous symptom, respectively. Use the "Cancel" button to pop-down
the questionnaire; if you have any unsaved changes, Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant
will ask if you want to save them. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If you plan to use the questionnaire to generate an initial list of
symptoms, you will want to tailor the syntax of your answers to optimize the
symptom selection process. To match up symptoms, answers are broken down into
sentences, and significant words from each sentence are used to produce a list
of synonyms. Sentences which contain the word "or" are broken into phrases
before and after the word "or". All of the synonyms in a sentence or phrase
must be contained in a symptom in order for it to be selected. For these
reasons, you will want to keep your sentences fairly short; accuracy will also
be improved if you stick to words commonly found in the Materia Medica (and
therefore in the Symptom List). </p>
