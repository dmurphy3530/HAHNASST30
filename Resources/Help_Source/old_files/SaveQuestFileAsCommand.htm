<h1>Save Quest. File As Command (File menu, main screen and questionnaire)</h1>
Use this command to save the active questionnaire file under a new name. Dr.
Hahnemanns Assistant displays the <a href="FileSaveAsDialogBox.htm">Save As
dialog box</a> so you can name your document. This is also a convenient way to
make a copy of an existing questionnaire file. The new file name will appear in
the title bar at the top of the screen. To save a questionnaire file with its
existing name and directory, use the <a href="SaveQuestFileCommand.htm">Save
