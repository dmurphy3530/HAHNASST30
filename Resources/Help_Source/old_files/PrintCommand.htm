<h1>Print Command (File menu, main screen)</h1>
You can use the Print command in the file menu of the main screen to print your
selected Symptom List or Questionnaire, select a printer, and set up the
printer's properties. When you select this command, the Windows Print Dialog
pops up. 

<p></p>

<p>If you have more than one printer driver installed or more than one printer
connected to your system or network, click on the arrow to the right of the
"Name:" box to pop-down a list of printers, then select the one you want. If
you want to print to a file, click in the "Print to File" box. To change the
setup for your printer, click the "Properties" button; the options this allows
you to choose will depend on your printer model and driver. Here, the "Printer"
portion of the pop-up dialog allows you to select a printer and the
"Properties" button allows you to set your printer's specific properties. The
"Paper" section of the dialog allows you to select the type of paper you are
using. Click the arrow to the right of the "Size" box to pop-down a scrollable
list of paper sizes; select the size your printer is using. Use the "Source"
box to select the source of paper. The choices in this box will depend on the
type of your printer; they could allow you to select a paper tray (make sure
the size matches your selected paper size), or they could allow you to select
between single sheets and continuous forms, etc. The "Orientation" section
allows you to select Portrait or Landscape paper orientation, and displays a
graphic next to your selection indicating the appearance of the paper. If you
will be printing a Symptom List, you may want to choose Landscape, as the
symptoms tend to be long and this will result in less "wrapping" of lines. You
may also wish to use this setting for questionnaires, for a similar reason.
Prescribed remedy names will generally appear neater (and require less paper)
if printed in Portrait orientation. For individual remedy Symptom Lists, you
may want to view the screen first and use your own judgment for the
orientation. </p>

<p></p>

<p>In the "Print Range" section, you will normally want to leave the "All"
option checked. The "Selection" option is used to print a portion of your
document which you have highlighted. Because the "Must Box" and "Selected
Symptoms" list allow you to choose (highlight) only one item at a time, you
would only be able to print one symptom with this option. </p>

<p></p>

<p>To print more than one copy, click the arrows to the right of the "Number of
Copies:" box to scroll to the number you want to print. </p>

<p></p>

<p>When you are satisfied with the print options you have selected, click the
"OK" button to begin printing. If you do not desire to print, click the
"Cancel" button. See your Windows documentation or Help topic for a full
description of the Print Dialog. </p>
