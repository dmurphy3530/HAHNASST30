<h1>New Case File Command (File menu, main screen)</h1>
Use this command to create and open a new case file in Dr. Hahnemanns
Assistant. Note that when you first run Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant a new case
file is created automatically; the purpose of the "New Case File" command is to
create a new case file after you have already saved or closed that file or
opened another case file. The default file name selected by the New menu is
CASEn.CSE, where n is a number, one higher than the highest-numbered case file
that already exists. The new case file name will appear in the title bar at the
top of the screen. You will have an opportunity to change the file name the
first time you use the <a href="SaveCaseFileCommand.htm">Save Case File</a>
command. If you have a file already open when you choose this option, a dialog
box will pop-up if you have made changes in your Symptom List since last saving
this file; this dialog box will allow you to save your current changes before
opening the new file. When the new file opens, all symptom selections are
cleared.
