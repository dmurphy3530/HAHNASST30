<h1>The Prescribed Remedies List</h1>
Clicking the Prescribe button brings up the Prescribed Remedies list. This list
is in the form of a scroll box, similar to the <a
href="TheSymptomList.htm">Symptoms</a> and <a
href="TheSelectButtonAndSelectedSymptomsList.htm">Selected Symptoms</a> lists.
See the discussion on the Symptoms list for a detailed description on using the
scroll bars. The Prescribed Remedies list contains the numbers by which the
Prescriber ranked the remedies, followed by the remedy name abbreviation (in
CAPS), the Latin name, and the English name for each remedy. For lesser-known
remedies, the Latin and English names may be the same. Some remedy names may be
followed by a *; this indicates more commonly-available remedies, which can be
obtained at many health-food or vitamin stores.

<p>Below the list are four buttons. <a name="L65" id="L65"></a>The "Export
Presc." button allows you to export the Prescribed Remedies list to a
tab-delimited file, suitable for import into a spreadsheet for graphing, etc.
When you click it, a "Save File" dialog pops up which allows you to choose a
folder and file name; the default extension for this file is ".PRE", but you
may change the extension if you wish. If the file name you enter already exists
in the folder you select, a warning dialog will pop-up and you will have the
option to change the file name or overwrite the existing file. <a name="L69"
id="L69"></a>The Print Presc. button works in a manner similar to the Print
option of the <a name="File" id="File" href="FileMenuCommands.htm">File
menu</a>, except that it is used to print the Prescribed Remedies list. A Print
Preview option is also available for this list. The Print button brings up the
Windows Print dialog, which allows you to select a printer and options as well
as to limit the number of pages printed. Lines longer than the page width are
wrapped around to the next line on the page. The Done button pops down the list
and returns you to the main screen. </p>

<p>To view more detail for a particular remedy, you can highlight its name in
the list and click the "Show Remedy" button. Alternatively, you can
double-click on the remedy name in the list. This will bring up a complete list
of symptoms for that particular remedy. For a detailed discussion of the remedy
Symptom List, see the description of the <a
