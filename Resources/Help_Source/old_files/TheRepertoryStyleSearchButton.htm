<H1>The "Repertory-Style Search" Button and Symptom Lists</H1>

The "Repertory-Style" search button presents the Symptom List in a sequentially-detailed format, which makes it easier to search.  Instead of showing all symptoms in a single list, the symptoms are broken into phrases, and those having identical phrases appear as a single item in the list.  For example, all symptoms beginning with the word "Stomach," appear as the single item "Stomach,..." in the list.  Symptoms which require additional phrases to complete them are indicated by the "..." following the phrase; when you click on them another list pops up with one or more additional phrases.  If a symptom has no more phrases, it is followed by a single period; when you click on it, no additional list comes up, and you may select it with the "Select" or "Must Use" buttons.  These work just like the buttons on the main form; the "Select" button copies the symptom to the Selected Symptoms" list and the "Must Use" button copies it to the "Must Box".  When you select a symptom phrase which ends in "...", the phrase appears in the window at the top of the list and another list pops up which contains the next phrase of all symptoms beginning with the phrase you selected; these are combined in a manner similar to the first list.  As with the first list, symptoms which have additional phrases are followed by "..."; symptoms for which no more phrases exist are followed by a single period.  The selection process continues in this manner until the entire symptom definition is selected.  After you select a symptom, you may use the buttons numbered 1 - 6 to assign a symptom weight.  These work exactly like the weight buttons on the main form.  As you build up a symptom by selecting phrases, the combined phrases appear in the box at the top of the first list; selected phrases from each list also appear in the boxes at the top of these lists.  As the lists pop up, the boxes containing selected phrases remain visible; it is recommended you don't drag these boxes, so you can easily view your selections.  Note that you can only select one symptom or phrase at a time on these forms.  Clicking the "Close" button closes the top-most list so you can continue selecting symptoms that have the same beginning phrase.  Clicking the "Done" button in any list except the first one pops down all lists except the first one so you may continue your search.  To end the repertory-style search, click the "Done" button in the first form; this will pop down the first list and de-select the "Repertory-style search" item in the Options menu.

If you want to select most of your symptoms from the complete list and plan to use the use the "Repertory-Style" search method only occasionally, you should use the "Repertory-Style Search Button" instead.
