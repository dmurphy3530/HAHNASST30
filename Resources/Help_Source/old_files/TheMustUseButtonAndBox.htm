<h1>The Must Use Button and Box</h1>
The "Must Use" box allows you to specify a symptom which must be associated
with all remedies produced by the "Prescribe" button. To copy a symptom to the
Must Use list, click on the Must Use button. If more than one symptom is
highlighted, the first highlighted symptom which is not already selected will
be copied. If no symptoms are highlighted when you click this button, or if all
highlighted symptoms are already selected, nothing will happen. Note that the
Must Use box can only contain one item. If you click the Must Use button and
there is already a symptom in the box, a dialog will pop up asking you if you
want to move the current Must Use symptom to the Selected Symptoms list or
delete it. When you click the desired button on this dialog, the symptom moves
out of the box and the new Must Use symptom replaces it. If you elected to move
it to the <a href="TheSelectButtonAndSelectedSymptomsList.htm">Selected
Symptoms</a> list, it is inserted into that list in alpha-numeric order; it
will remain highlighted when scrolled into view in the <a
href="TheSymptomList.htm">Symptoms</a> list. If you elected to delete it, it
will not be highlighted when scrolled into view in the Symptoms list.
