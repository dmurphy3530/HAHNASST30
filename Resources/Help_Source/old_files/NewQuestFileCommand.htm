<h1>New Quest. File Command (File menu, main screen and questionnaire form)</h1>
Use this command to create and open a new questionnaire file. Note that when
you first run Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant a new questionnaire file is created
automatically; the purpose of the "New Quest. File" command is to create a new
questionnaire file after you have already saved or closed that file or opened
another questionnaire file. The default file name selected by the New Quest.
File menu is QUESTn.QUE, where n is a number, one higher than the
highest-numbered questionnaire file that already exists. The new questionnaire
file name will appear in the title bar at the top of the screen. You will have
an opportunity to change the file name the first time you use the <a
href="SaveQuestFileCommand.htm">Save quest. File command</a>. If you have a
questionnaire file already open when you choose this option, a dialog box will
pop-up if you have made changes in your questionnaire since last saving this
file; this dialog box will allow you to save your current changes before
opening the new file. When the new file opens, all questionnaire answers are
cleared.
