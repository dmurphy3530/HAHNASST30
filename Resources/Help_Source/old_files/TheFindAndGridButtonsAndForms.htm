<h1>The Find and Grid Buttons and Forms</h1>
The Find / Grid button is actually two buttons; the button on top with the word
"Find" allows you to search for a single word in the Symptom List. The button
on the bottom with the word "Grid" allows you to specify several words to
search for at once. 

<p></p>

<p><a name="L132" id="L132"></a>Clicking the <a name="L128" id="L128"></a>Find
button brings up a dialog with a text box labeled <a name="L154"
id="L154"></a>"Find what:" for you to enter in the word you wish to search for.
To enter your text, click inside the box if the vertical flashing cursor is not
already in it, and type the text. When you type the first letter or number of
your word, a list of words will pop-up below your letter. This list contains
all the words and numbers that you can search for in the Symptom List, in
alphabetical order; the top word in this list will be the first word you can
search for that begins with the letter you typed. If you continue typing
letters of your word, the list will adjust itself so that the first occurrence
of the letters you typed so far is on its top line. If you make a mistake, use
the Backspace key to delete the last letter typed. Alternatively, you can click
the "Clear" key to the left of the word list to clear your entire word. At any
point in the process you may select a word from the list by clicking on it; if
the word you want is not visible, use the scroll bar to the right of the list
to scroll up or down until you see it. If you click on a word in the list, it
will replace the word you typed in the text box. You can only search for words
contained in the list; if you type in a word not in the list and try to search
for it, a message will pop up informing you that the word you typed is not in
the list. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that searches are not case-sensitive; all the words in the list begin
with lower-case letters, but will search for matching words regardless of
whether or not they are capitalized in the symptom. </p>

<p></p>

<p>To the left of the word list is an option button labeled <a name="L134"
id="L134"></a>"Exact Match". If this option is not selected (the button is
blank), the search will look for words which match your search word, and also
words which have extra letters at the end. For example, a search for the word
"pain" would search for "pain", "painful", "painful/soreness", "painfully",
"painfulness", "painless", "painlessness", and "pains". If the Exact Match
option is selected, only the exact word you selected is searched for. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you have entered or selected your search word and set the desired
"Exact Match" option, you are ready to begin the search. There are four search
buttons which allow you to specify how to search the Symptom List. <a
name="L138" id="L138"></a>TheFind First Button will find the first occurrence
of your word in the Symptom List, regardless of where the list is currently
positioned. When it finds your word, it scrolls the Symptom List so that the
symptom containing your word is on the top line, if possible; if your word is
in a position such that placing its symptom in the top line would scroll past
the bottom of the list, it is scrolled to the end; your symptom will be
visible, but may not be on the top line. <a name="L142" id="L142"></a>The Find
Next Button starts looking at the top line of the Symptom List currently
displayed, and searches down for your word. If it reaches the end of the list,
it asks you if you want to continue your search at the top; click "Yes" to
continue or "No" to end your search. <a name="L146" id="L146"></a>The Find Prev
Button works exactly like the Find Next Button, except it searches up in the
Symptom List. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The search dialog box has a modeless property, which means it stays
displayed even after the search is finished, and you may work with the main
form below it while it is displayed. This is done to allow you to continue your
search for the same or another string. After the first string is found, you can
use the Find Next button to continue your search. There is also a Help button
which will bring up a brief help screen for the Search Dialog. When you are
done searching, you can un-display the dialog by clicking on its Cancel button
or typing the <Esc>key. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Helpful hints: When you first type a word in the box, the "Find First"
button will be the "default" button (denoted by the black line which will
surround it); you can select this button by typing the <Enter>key. After the
first match is found, the "Find Next" button becomes the default. This allows
you to do a sequential search without having to use the mouse. Also, you can
pop down the "Find" box if it gets in the way, and it will remember your last
search word when you pop it back up. If you want to search for a new word, you
can use the "Clear" key to quickly clear the previous word from the box. </p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L92" id="L92"></a>If you are interested in all symptoms which
contain your word, searching the list one symptom at a time could get rather
tedious, especially for a common word like "pain". <a name="L150"
id="L150"></a>You can bring up a list of all symptoms which contain your word
by clicking theFind All Button. <a name="L94" id="L94"></a>This button pops up
a list of all symptoms which contain your word. The list will cover up the
Symptom List and will have the "Select", "Must Use", and "Weight" buttons below
the list and the symptom display box above the list, just like the Symptom
List. <a name="L98" id="L98"></a>You may select symptoms using this list, just
as if it were the Symptom List. When you are finished selecting from the "Find
All" list, click the "Done" button at the bottom to pop it down. It is
recommended that you do not move this form to another portion of the screen;
doing so could cover up your Selected Symptoms or Must Use lists, or buttons or
menu options you may need. </p>
