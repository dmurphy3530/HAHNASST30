<h1>Automatically Assign Weight command (Options menu)</h1>
The "Automatically Assign Weight" command is an aid to weighting symptoms if
you wish to use the common "holistic" model of symptom weighting. This model
begins by assigning a strength of 1 to 3 to the symptom, with 1 being the
weakest and 3 the strongest. To this number, add 1 for specific physical
symptoms, add 2 for general symptoms, or add 3 for mind symptoms. If this
option is turned on, the "Auto-Weight Severity" dialog box will pop up every
time you select a symptom. This box will display the symptom, with buttons
below it which allow you to assign it a priority of High, Medium, or Low. Dr.
Hahnemann's Assistant ranks the symptom as being physical, general, or mind,
and adds the priority of the button you selected to this number to determine
the symptom weight. Clicking the "High" button adds a 3, the "Medium" adds a 2,
and the "Low" adds a 1. When the symptom appears in the Select List or the Must
Box, this weight will appear in front of it. If you decide to change this
weight later on, you can select the symptom in the Select List or Must Box by
clicking on it, then click on the desired weight button. If you change your
mind and decide not to select the symptom, click the "Cancel Symptom" button on
the "Auto-Weight Severity" box to pop it down.
