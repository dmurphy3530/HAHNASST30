<body>
<h1>File Save As dialog box</h1>
The File Save As dialog box is similar to the File Open dialog box. It contains
options which allow you to specify the name and location of the file you're
about to save. The complete path where the file will be saved will be a
combination of the name in the File Name box and the drive letter and path name
in the "Save in" box. 

<p></p>

<p><b>File Name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">If the file name listed is the name you want to
save the file to, leave it as-is. Otherwise, type the file name you want to
save to; do not include the folder name or disk letter.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>List Files of Type</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">To select the type of file you want to open, click
the arrow to the right of the box, then click on the type you want in the
pop-down list:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">*.CSE</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">*.*</p>

<p></p>

<p>The large rectangular area displays the folders in the "current" folder, and
all files whose extension (the part of the file name to the right of the ".")
matches the one you select in "List Files of Type". Note that the "*" is a
"wildcard", and will match any number of letters or numbers. If there are too
many files to display in the list, a scroll bar will appear at the bottom of
the list. Use this scrollbar to move the list right or left to display
additional files.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Save in:</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">This box displays the name of the folder
(directory) being displayed in the list. To change folders to a higher level,
click on the arrow to the right of the box to bring up a list of drives and
folders in Windows Explorer format. You may need to scroll this list up or down
to get to a particular drive or folder. To get to a lower level in the "tree",
see the next item below. Note that this list displays in a "tree" format; if
the folder you want is in another branch of the "tree", you will need to go
back to a "parent" folder or drive to your file, and navigate down from
there.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Displaying a sub-folder</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Folders which are sub-folders of the one in the
"Look in:" box have a file-folder icon to the left of their name in the list.
To display the contents of one of these folders, double-click on its name or
icon in the list.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Navigating up a level</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">To easily go up to the next level without selecting
from the "Look in:" list, click the button with the folder icon with the arrow
in it, which is located to the right of the "Look in:" box.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Network...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">If your computer is part of a network, the network
drives may appear as additional drive letters in the "Look in:" list, or as a
system "handle" (name) in the list. Navigate to the network computer as you
would to another drive on your computer, by selecting its drive letter or name
from the list.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Create New Folder</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">To create a new folder in the "save in:" folder,
click the button to the right of the "Up One Level" button. A folder icon with
the name "New Folder" will appear in the list. Type the name you want for the
new folder.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>List/Details options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">You can choose the type of display you want for
your folder/file list. To display only folder and file names (the default),
click the "List" button (the second button from the right at the top); to
display file size, type, and last modification date, click the "Details" button
(the right-most button at the top).</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Context Help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">As with all windows in Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant,
the File Save Dialog Box offers context-sensitive help. To access this help
feature, click on the "?" button at the top right of the dialog; your cursor
will change into a question mark. Move this cursor to the item in the dialog
you want help for, and click on it to bring up a help message for that item.
When you are done reading the message, click anywhere to stop displaying it.</p>
