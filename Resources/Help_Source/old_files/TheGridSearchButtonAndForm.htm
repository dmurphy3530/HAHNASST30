<h1>The "Grid Search" Button and form</h1>
The button marked "Grid" below the "Find" button brings up the "Power Grid
Search" form. This form allows you to specify more than one search word. It
functions in a manner similar to the "<a href="FindForm.htm">Find</a>" form,
but allows you to logically AND and OR search words together. You enter words
just as you do in the "Find" form, by clicking on a <a name="L75"
id="L75"></a>text box to select it, typing a letter to pop-up the <a name="L50"
id="L50"></a>word list, etc. Words entered in the same row are ANDED together;
for example, if a row contained the words "pain" and "stomach", only the
symptoms which contain both "pain" AND "stomach" would satisfy the search.
Words or groups of words entered in different rows are ORED together; if the
words in the previous example were entered in separate rows, symptoms which
contain either "pain" OR "stomach" would satisfy the search. Words do not have
to be in the same column to be ORED together. ORing words or groups of words
allows you to search for several symptoms at the same time. <a name="L54"
id="L54"></a>Each text box has an option button to the right of it, which
allows you to request an exact match for individual words. If you want to
search for an exact match for all your words, you can click the "Exact Match
All" button at the top left of the screen to set all of them. The rest of the
buttons at the top of the screen have the same functions as the corresponding
buttons in the "Find" form. The "Clear All" button can be used to conveniently
clear all your words. If there were any blank boxes to the left of or between
entries in any row, they are automatically moved as far to the left in the grid
as possible before the search begins. In a similar manner, rows will be moved
up as far as possible. 

<p></p>

<p>The Power Grid Search dialog box has a modeless property, which means it
stays displayed even after the search is finished, and you may work with the
main form below it while it is displayed. This is done to allow you to continue
your search for the same or another string. After the first string is found,
you can use the <a name="L67" id="L67"></a>Find Next button to continue your
search. There is also a Help button which will bring up a brief help screen for
the Power Grid Search Dialog. When you are done searching, you can un-display
the dialog by clicking on its Cancel button or typing the <Esc>key. </p>

<p></p>

<p>It is possible to enter combinations of words which will not be found in the
Symptom List. If this happens, a dialog will pop-up to tell you that "No
matches were found." If you were doing a "Find First" and this message appears,
you can be certain that the word combination is not in the Symptom List. If it
appears after a "Find Next" or <a name="L71" id="L71"></a>"Find Previous", it
means the word combination was not found between the current list location and
the end or beginning of the list. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Helpful hints: When you first type a word or words in any box(s), the <a
name="L63" id="L63"></a>"Find First" button will be the "default" button
(denoted by the black line which will surround it); you can select this button
by typing the <Enter>key. After the first match is found, the "Find Next"
button becomes the default. This allows you to do a sequential search without
having to use the mouse. Also, you can pop down the "Power Grid Search" box if
it gets in the way, and it will remember your last search words when you pop it
back up. If you want to search for new words, you can use the "Clear" key to
quickly clear the previous word(s) from the box. You can enter your words in
any column or row; you don't have to start with the first ones. The
<tab>&lt;tab&gt; key will move the cursor to the next text box, or the first
box of the row below if it is in the last box of a row. If the pop-down word
list gets in your way, click anywhere on the Power Grid Search dialog to pop it
down, or start entering text in another text box to move it to the new box.
While the pop-down word list is displayed, the "Exact Match" buttons to the
right of the text boxes disappear to prevent them from interfering with its
scroll function; to re-display them, click on the Power Grid Search dialog to
pop the list down. While you can use the Power Grid Search to search for single
words just as you use the "Find" dialog box, it may be less convenient to use
due to its large size. </p>
