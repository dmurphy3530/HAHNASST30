<h1>The Select Button and Selected Symptoms List</h1>
Clicking on the Select button copies all highlighted symptoms in the <a
href="TheSymptomList.htm">Symptoms list</a> which are not already in the Must
Use box or Selected Symptoms list to the Selected Symptoms list. Only symptoms
which are highlighted and in the view are copied. If no symptoms are
highlighted when you click this button, or if all highlighted symptoms are
already selected, nothing will happen. Symptoms copied into the "Selected
Symptoms" list are inserted in alpha-numeric order.
