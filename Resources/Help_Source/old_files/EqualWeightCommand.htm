<h1>Equal Weight command (Options menu)</h1>
The equal weight prescribing scheme is identical to the <a
href="DefaultCommand.htm">Default</a> scheme, except that it doesnt use the
weight factors contained in the remedy Symptom Lists (remedy weights). The
symptom weights which you assign with the <a href="TheWeightButtons.htm">Weight
Buttons</a> (or which the program assigns if you are using the <a
href="AutomaticallyAssignWeightCommand.htm">Automatically Assign Weight</a>
option) are multiplied by the individual symptom percentage values. These
numbers are than added up for each remedy as in the Default scheme. As with the
<a href="DefaultCommand.htm">Default</a> option, it is possible for these
numbers to add up to more than 100 if case weights greater than 1 are used
(unless you have selected the <a href="NormalizeCommand.htm">Normalize</a>
option).
