<h1>Default command (Options menu)</h1>
This prescribing scheme bases its prediction on the number of symptoms which
correspond to each remedy as a weighted percentage of that remedys total number
of symptoms. For example, if a remedy has 8 single weight symptoms associated
with it and you selected 4 of those symptoms in your case, its weighted percent
would be 50 (100 * (4 / 8)). Symptoms which appear with a single asterisk after
them in the remedy display are weighted double (this means they count as two
symptoms when figuring the percent). Symptoms which appear with two asterisks
after them are weighted by a factor of 4.

<p>The Default scheme is a good general remedy selection scheme, in that it
takes into account the fact that some remedies may have many symptoms while
others have few. If used with Minimum Numbers higher than 1, it will tend to
favor the Polychrests (remedies which have many different symptoms); these
remedies tend to be more readily available due to their multiple uses. It also
takes into account key symptoms which are important indicators for a remedy,
and is generally the best scheme to start with on new cases. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The weighting scheme used by Default should not be confused with the case
weights you assign with the <a href="TheWeightButtons.htm">Weight Buttons</a>
(or which the program assigns if you are using the <a
href="AutomaticallyAssignWeightCommand.htm">Automatically Assign Weight</a>
option). These case weights are multiplied by the individual symptom
percentages before adding them up for each remedy; for this reason, the
percentage for a given remedy could well be greater than 100 if case weights
greater than 1 are used (unless you have selected the <a
href="NormalizeCommand.htm">Normalize</a> option). This is perfectly
legitimate, as the percentages are meant as a relative guideline, and not as
absolute numbers. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Default scheme works as follows: Certain symptoms are given greater
weight in relation to other symptoms for a given remedy. Symptoms which have a
* after their name on the Symptom List are counted as 2 symptoms. Other
symptoms, noted by **, are considered determining factors in prescribing the
remedy and count as 4 symptoms. These remedy weights of either 1, 2, or 4 are
then multiplied by your assigned <a href="TheWeightButtons.htm">symptom
weight</a> (1-6), to determine the final weight of the symptom. </p>
