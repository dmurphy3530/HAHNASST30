<h1>Minimum Number submenu (Options menu)</h1>
The words Minimum Number appear below a line on the Options Menu, and are
followed by ...; this indicates that this option will pop-up a sub-menu when
you click on it. The sub-menu contains the numbers 1 through 6, with a check
mark next to one of the numbers, indicating the current selection. These
numbers are used to set the minimum number of symptoms for a remedy that you
must have in your case before it will be considered in prescribing. This is a
way of limiting the number of remedies which will be suggested. It is also a
good way to show up lesser-known remedies which may have only two or three
symptoms. 

<p></p>

<p>One way to point out lesser-known remedies would be to print out a
prescribed remedy list with the Minimum Number set to 1, then to print it again
with the number set to 3 or more; the list with the higher minimum number will
tend to display only the Polychrest (multiple-symptom-type) remedies. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Using a minimum number of 1 tends to favor the lesser-known,
(non-Polychrest) remedies, and can be useful in cases where Polychrests have
been tried but failed to produce a cure. </p>

<p></p>

<p>To select a minimum number, click on the Minimum Number item to bring up the
number list, then click on the number you wish to use. A check mark will appear
beside your new selection. This number is initially set to 1 when you first run
Dr. Hahnemanns Assistant. </p>
