<h1>The Weight Buttons</h1>
The six numbered buttons to the right of the <a
href="TheFindAndGridButtons.htm">Find</a> button are used for assigning Symptom
Weights. These weights can be assigned to symptoms in the <a
href="TheMustUseButtonAndBox.htm">Must Use</a> box and the <a
href="TheSelectButtonAndSelectedSymptomsList.htm">Selected Symptoms</a> list.
The box and list are linked together such that only one item can be highlighted
at one time, to facilitate assigning the weight. If you click on an item in the
Selected Symptoms list while the Must Use item is highlighted, the Must Use
highlight goes away and Moves to the symptom you clicked on. A similar action
takes place when you click on a symptom in the Must Use box. If an item in the
Selected Symptoms list is highlighted and you click on another item, the
highlight moves to the new item. To assign a different Symptom Weight,
highlight a symptom in either the Must Use box or Selected Symptoms list, then
click on one of the six weight buttons corresponding to the number you want to
assign to the weight. As soon as you click the button, the weight number
changes to the new value. If the symptom you want to set the weight for is not
visible in the list, scroll the list until it becomes visible, click on the
symptom to highlight it, and then click the desired Weight button. A shortcut
method for assigning weights is to click the weight button right after you
select the symptom. Symptoms are automatically highlighted in the Must Use box
or Selected Symptoms list immediately after they are selected; assigning the
weight at this time saves having to scroll the list or highlight symptoms.
Because the Selected Symptoms list is always in alpha-numeric order, changing
the weight of the symptom will usually cause it to immediately change places in
the list as soon as you click the weight button. </body>
