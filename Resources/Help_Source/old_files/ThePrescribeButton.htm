<h1>The Prescribe Button</h1>
To the right of the <a href="TheDeleteSelButton.htm">Delete Sel</a> button is a
slightly larger button labeled Prescribe. This button will be grayed out,
indicating it is inactive, if neither the <a
href="TheMustUseButtonAndBox.htm">Must Use</a> box nor the <a
href="TheSelectButtonAndSelectedSymptomsList.htm">Selected Symptoms</a> list
contain any items. When you click on the Prescribe button, Dr. Hahnemanns
Assistant searches its database for all remedies associated with your selected
symptoms. It then assigns them a number, based on the number of symptoms
selected for that remedy, your prescribing scheme, the symptom weights you
assigned, and optionally the remedy weights. See the section on the <a
href="OptionsMenuCommands.htm">Options Menu</a> commands for a detailed
discussion of prescribing schemes. If you selected a <a
href="MinimumNumberSubmenu.htm">Minimum Number</a> greater than 1, remedies
will only be displayed if they are associated with at least that number of
symptoms in your case. If you selected a Must Use symptom, only remedies which
contain that symptom will be displayed. Remedies are displayed in order of
highest ranking to lowest; this means that the remedy which Dr. Hahnemanns
Assistant predicts most likely to succeed will appear at the top of the list.
The remedy list is limited to 100 remedies. </body>
