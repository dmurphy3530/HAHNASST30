<h1>The Delete Must Button</h1>
Directly below the <a href="TheMustUseButtonAndBox.htm">Must Use</a> box is the
Delete Must button. Clicking on this button will allow you to delete an item in
the Must Use box. If there is not a symptom in the Must Use box, this button is
grayed out, indicating it is inactive. The Must Use symptom does not have to be
highlighted to delete it. When you click this button, a box will pop-up with
the question, Move current must-use selection to selected list? Clicking on Yes
will move the symptom out of the Must Use box, and it will be inserted into the
<a href="TheSelectButtonAndSelectedSymptomsList.htm">Selected Symptoms</a>
list. Clicking No deletes the symptom from the Must Use box; the symptom will
no longer be considered in prescribing, and it will be un-highlighted if you
move it into view in the Symptoms list. It is possible to re-select symptoms
that have been deleted. </body>
