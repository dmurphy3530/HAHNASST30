<H1>Close Quest. File Command (File menu, main screen and questionnaire)</H1>

Use this command to close the active questionnaire file.  After you close the file, the file name is replaced by the word NONE after "Quest File:" in the title bar to indicate there is no active questionnaire file.  If you have made changes to your file since last saving it, Dr. Hahnemanns Assistant pops-up a dialog box which allows you to save changes to your file before you close it.  If you select No to the prompt, you lose all changes made since the last time you saved it.
