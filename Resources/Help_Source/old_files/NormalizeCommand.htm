<h1>Normalize command (Options menu)</h1>
The Normalize option has different effects depending on which prescribing
option is chosen. 

<p></p>

<p>If the <a href="DefaultCommand.htm">Default</a> method is set, the number
which appears before each remedy represents the ratio of the un-normalized
number you would get, to the maximum weighted number possible for that remedy.
This maximum weighted number is the number you would get if you were to have
all the symptoms for that remedy and were to rate them as your most important
symptom. The formula used for this maximum weighted number is as follows:
assign a strength of 1 to 3 to the symptom, with 1 being the weakest and 3 the
strongest; to this number, add 1 for specific physical symptoms, add 2 for
general symptoms, or add 3 for mind symptoms; next multiply this number by two
for all symptoms followed by a single "*" and by four for those followed by
"**". The sum of these numbers for all symptoms for the remedy will give the
maximum weighted number used in the normalization formula. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If the <a href="EqualWeightCommand.htm">Equal Weight</a> method is set, the
number which appears before each remedy represents the ratio of the
un-normalized number you would get, to the maximum weighted number possible for
that remedy with the Equal Weight option. This is similar to the method used
for normalizing the Default option, with the difference that the maximum
weighted number multiplies all symptom weights by one, including those symptoms
followed by a single "*" or "**". </p>

<p></p>

<p>If the <a href="StraightCountCommand.htm">Straight Count</a> method is set,
the number which appears before each remedy is calculated as follows: multiply
the number of symptoms chosen for each remedy (this is the number that would
appear if the Normalize option were not used) by the number required to make
the symptom count for the remedy with the highest number equal to 100.00. In
other words, if you had two remedies, and the straight counts were 2 and 5, the
Normalized version would be 40.00 and 100.00 (100 / 5 = 20, 2 * 5 = 40). </p>
