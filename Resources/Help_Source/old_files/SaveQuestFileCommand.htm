<h1>Save Quest. File Command (File menu, main screen and questionnaire)</h1>
Use this command to save the active questionnaire file to its current name and
directory. The first time you save a questionnaire file after you run Dr.
Hahnemann's Assistant or after opening a new questionnaire file, the "Save As"
dialog box will pop up to allow you to choose the file name. If you want to
change the name and directory of an existing document that you have already
saved, choose the <a href="SaveQuestFileAsCommand.htm">Save Quest. File As
command</a>. </body>
