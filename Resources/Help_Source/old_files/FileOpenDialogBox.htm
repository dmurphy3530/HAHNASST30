<H1>File Open Dialog Box</H1>

The following options allow you to specify which file to open:

File Name

Type the filename you want to open, or select it by clicking on it in the list above the box.

List Files of Type

To select the type of file you want to open, click the arrow to the right of the box, then click on the type you want in the pop-down list:
*.CSE
*.*


The large rectangular area displays the folders in the "current" folder, and all files whose extension (the part of the file name to the right of the ".") matches the one you select in "List Files of Type".  Note that the "*" is a "wildcard", and will match any number of letters or numbers.  If there are too many files to display in the list, a scroll bar will appear at the bottom of the list.  Use this scrollbar to move the list right or left to display additional files.

Look in:

This box displays the name of the folder (directory) being displayed in the list.  To change folders to a higher level, click on the arrow to the right of the box to bring up a list of drives and folders in Windows Explorer format.  You may need to scroll this list up or down to get to a particular drive or folder.  To get to a lower level in the "tree", see the next item below.  Note that this list displays in a "tree" format; if the folder you want is in another branch of the "tree", you will need to go back to a "parent" folder or drive to your file and navigate down from there.

Displaying a sub-folder

Folders which are sub-folders of the one in the "Look in:" box have a file-folder icon to the left of their name in the list.  To display the contents of one of these folders, double-click on its name or icon in the list.

Navigating up a level

To easily go up to the next level without selecting from the "Look in:" list, click the button with the folder icon and the arrow in it, which is located to the right of the "Look in:" box.

Network...

If your computer is part of a network, the network drives may appear as additional drive letters in the "Look in:" list, or as a system "handle" (name) in the list.  Navigate to the network computer as you would to another drive on your computer, by selecting its drive letter or name from the list. 

Create New Folder

To create a new folder in the "look in:" folder, click the button to the right of the "Up One Level" button.  A folder icon with the name "New Folder" will appear in the list.  Type the name you want for the new folder.

List/Details options

You can choose the type of display you want for your folder/file list.  To display only folder and file names (the default), click the "List" button (the second button from the right at the top); to display file size, type, and last modification date, click the "Details" button (the right-most button at the top).

Context Help

As with all windows in Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant, the File Open Dialog Box offers context-sensitive help.  To access this help feature, click on the "?" button at the top right of the dialog; your cursor will change into a question mark.  Move this cursor to the item in the dialog you want help for, and click on it to bring up a help message for that item.  When you are done reading the message, click anywhere to stop displaying it.
