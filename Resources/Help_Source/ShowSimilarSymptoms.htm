<h1> 	The “Show Similar Symptoms” button
</h1>
<p>Whenever you click on a symptom in the “SYMPTOMS LIST”, “MUST USE” box, or “SELECTED SYMPTOMS” list, its text will display in the text box just below the toolbar (or the menu options if the toolbar isn't displayed).  If you would like to see a list of symptoms similar to the one in this text box, click the “<Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Show Similar Symptoms">
</OBJECT>” button.  This will pop-up the “Find All” list which allows you to select one or more of these symptoms in a manner similar to that available on the front panel.
