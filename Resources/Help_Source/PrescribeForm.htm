<p>Clicking the Prescribe button brings up the <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Prescribed Remedies list">
</OBJECT>Prescribed Remedies list.  This list is in the form of a list box, similar to the "Symptoms" and "Selected Symptoms" lists.  See the discussion on the "Symptoms" list for a detailed description on using the scroll bars.  The Prescribed Remedies list contains the numbers by which the Prescriber ranked the remedies, followed by the remedy name abbreviation (in CAPS), the Latin name, and the English name for each remedy.  For lesser-known remedies, the Latin and English names may be the same.  Some remedy names may be followed by a "*"; this indicates more commonly-available remedies, which can be obtained locally many health-food / vitamin stores.</p>

<p>Below the list are four buttons.  The <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="show prescribed remedy information">
</OBJECT>“Show Remedy” button will only be enabled if a symptom is selected.  It will bring up the “Remedy & Associated Symptoms” form with the information for the selected remedy.  The <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="exporting prescribed remedies list">
</OBJECT>"Export Presc." button allows you to export the Prescribed Remedies list to a tab-delimited file, suitable for import into a spreadsheet for graphing, etc.  When you click it, a "Save File" dialog pops up which allows you to choose a folder and file name; the default extension for this file is ".PRE", but you may change the extension if you wish.  If the file name you enter already exists in the folder you select, a warning dialog will pop-up and you will have the option to change the file name or overwrite the existing file.  The <Object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<param name="Keyword" value="Print Prescription button">
</OBJECT>“Print Presc.” button works in a manner similar to the “Print” option of the File menu, except that it is used to print the Prescribed Remedies list.  No “Print Preview” option is available for this list.  The “Print” button brings up the Windows Print dialog, which allows you to limit the number of pages printed.  Lines longer than the page width are wrapped around to the next line on the page.  If you want to combine the “Presc” report with others such as the list of symptoms, use the File menu “Print” option while the “Prescribed Remedies” form is popped up. </p>
