<h1>Set Preferences command (Options menu)</h1>
The Set Preferences command of the Options menu allows you to specify printer
font, screen font, text background (surrounding) color, and text foreground
(letters) color. 

<p></p>

<p><a name="L71" id="L71"></a>Click in thePrinter Font check box to bring up
the Windows font dialog and specify the font for printing. To select a font,
you can either scroll the Font list and click on the font name you want, or
type the name in the box under the "Font:" label. Note that as you begin to
type, the list will scroll to show font names beginning with the letters you
have already typed, as an aid to selection. <a name="L91" id="L91"></a>After
you select a font, an example will appear in the "Sample" window on the Font
pop-up. The box to the right of the "Font" box allows you to select a style for
the font. Select the style in the same manner you selected the font. To the
right of the "Font style" box is a box labeled "Size:". Use this to select the
point size from those available for the font. Take care in selecting sizes; too
small a size may be unreadable, while too large a size will not fit on the
page. If the font you choose is a TrueType font, a message will appear at the
bottom of the pop-up. The "Script" box allows you to select a script
appropriate to your language. When you are done setting your font, click the
"OK" button to continue with your changes, or the "Cancel" button to revert to
your old printer font. Note that the font you chose will not actually take
effect until you click the "Apply" button on the "Set Preferences" pop-up. </p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L73" id="L73"></a>You can change the font used for the letters
displayed on your screen (within the program) by clicking the Screen Font check
box. This will bring up the Windows font dialog. See the description of the
"Printer Font check box" above for instructions for using the font dialog. A
sample of the font you select will appear in the "SAMPLE" box on the "Set
Preferences" pop-up. </p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L77" id="L77"></a>Clicking theText Background Color check box
brings up the Windows color dialog. This dialog presents the colors available
on your computer in the "Basic colors:" section. To select one of these colors,
click on its square. If you want to define a color which doesn't appear in the
"Basic colors" section, click the "Define Custom Colors &gt;&gt;" button. This
adds a section to the right of the color dialog which allows you to create a
custom color. The color you create appears in the "Color|Solid" box. You can
set up your custom color by moving the cursors in the color boxes at the top,
by typing in the numbers 0 - 255 in the Hue, Sat., and Lum. boxes, or by typing
in the numbers 0 - 255 in the Red, Green, and Blue boxes. To move one of the
cursors, click on the square or the column at the position you want, and the
cursor will move where you point. Moving the cursor in the large square box
right or left affects the hue value. Moving it up and down affects the Sat.
value. Moving the cursor for the column to the right of this box affects the
Lum. value. If you prefer to specify colors by the amount of red, green, and
blue in the color, type the appropriate numbers in the Red, Green, and Blue
boxes. A value of 0 will give none of a color, while a value of 255 gives the
maximum amount of the color. When you are done setting up your custom color,
click the "Add to Custom Colors" button; your new color will appear in the
first unused box in the "Custom colors:" section. To use a custom color, click
on its box. When you are done selecting your color, click the "OK" button to
continue with your changes, or the "Cancel" button to revert to your old color.
The color you chose will appear in the "SAMPLE" box, but will not actually take
effect until you click the "Apply" button on the "Set Preferences" pop-up. </p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L79" id="L79"></a>To change the color of the letters on your
screen, click theText Foreground Color check box. This will bring up the
Windows color dialog. See the description of the "Text Background Color check
box" above for instructions on using the color dialog. You should take care
when choosing your screen colors that the foreground and background colors are
not so similar (or identical) to each other that the text on the screen will
not show up. </p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L81" id="L81"></a>Use the Restore Initial Settings check box to
return your screen colors and printer and screen fonts to those when you
originally installed Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant. When you click this box, a
dialog will pop-up asking you if you are sure you want to restore the initial
settings. To restore the settings, click "Yes"; to cancel your action, click
"No". If you click "Yes", the initial settings will be restored and the "Set
Preferences" dialog will pop-down. </p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="L83" id="L83"></a>Once you have set up your fonts and/or colors,
you may still discard your selections by clicking the "Cancel" button on the
"Set Preferences" dialog. If you want to save your preferences, click the <a
name="L991" id="L991"></a>Apply button; this will immediately apply your new
settings, pop-down the "Set Preferences" dialog, and store the preferences to
the Windows Registry. The next time you run Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant your
preferences will remain in effect. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The bottom portion of the "Set Preferences" dialog allows you to adjust
helpful features to your preferences and screen layout. <a name="L95"
id="L95"></a>Use the "Show Toolbar" option to display and hide the Toolbar,
which includes buttons for some of the most common commands in Dr. Hahnemanns
Assistant, such as File Open. <a name="L99" id="L99"></a>The "Show Status Bar"
option displays a bar at the bottom of the main screen which contains short
helpful messages relating to the item the mouse cursor is resting on. <a
name="L103" id="L103"></a>Use the "Show Tooltips" option to allow ToolTips to
be displayed. ToolTips are the short description which pops-up when you move
the mouse over a button, box, or list and leave it for a couple of seconds.
After you become familiar with the program, you may want to display ToolTips
for the toolbar, but not for other features. <a name="L328" id="L328"></a>To do
this, select the Toolbar ToolTips Only option. This option will only be
available if the Toolbar is displayed and "Show ToolTips" is selected. </p>
