<h1>Overview and Quick Start Instructions</h1>
<p></p>

<p>The concept behind Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant is relatively simple.  It contains a list of over 20000 symptoms, which you choose from to make up your “case”.  You have the option to view this list in several formats, including a complete alphabetical list of symptoms, a series of pop-up lists broken into phrases similar to the way they appear in a repertory, phrase search functions, and a case-style questionnaire.  The symptoms are taken from several Materia Medica.  Each symptom is associated with one or more Homeopathic remedies.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you are done selecting all the symptoms which describe your case, you are ready to prescribe the remedy.  Several symptom weighting options are available, as well as an option to limit the  number of remedies considered by requiring more than one selected symptom per remedy.  Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant uses your Symptom List and weighting criteria to search its table of remedies and generate a ranked list of remedies for your case.  This list is sorted in order of indication, with the most strongly-indicated remedy at the top.  There are also options to view Symptom Lists for individual remedies, and to print the case symptoms, prescribed remedy list, individual remedy Symptom Lists, and questionnaire.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>The following paragraphs take you through inputting a case and prescribing a remedy.  For a detailed description of an individual function such as searching the Symptom List, see the section under that particular function.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>Begin by <a href="TakingCases.htm"> making up your case</a> from the list of symptoms on the left side of the screen.  To navigate through the list of symptoms, you can use the scroll bar to the right of the list or the find or grid buttons.  The “Find” button brings up a dialog which allows you to specify the string to search for, as well as to tailor the search to make it easier to find your symptom.  The “Grid” button brings up a dialog similar to the one for the “Find” button, but you can enter multiple search words in a grid and have the ability to logically AND and OR them together.  When you locate the desired symptom in a list, click on it to highlight it.  Note that any number of symptoms in the view may be highlighted.  If you accidently click on the wrong symptom, click on it again to un-highlight it.  To complete the symptom selection, you must click either the “Select” or the “Must Use” button.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>If you find the Symptom List is a bit long and tedious to search, you may want to try the <a href="RepertoryStyleSymptomForms.htm">Repertory-Style</a> search.  To bring up this option, click the “Repertory-Style” button above the Symptom List.  This button brings up an abbreviated-format Symptom List which presents only the first phrases of symptoms, with those having identical first phrases combined.  Use the scroll bar just like the one on the Symptom List, or begin typing a phrase in the box above the list to quickly go to it.  If the phrase ends in an ellipsis ("..."), clicking on it will bring up a second list containing the next phrase of all symptoms which start with that phrase.  Continue in this manner to complete the symptom phrase.  When a symptom is complete, clicking on it will enable the buttons at the bottom of the box.  Use these buttons just like the ones on the main form to select your symptom or assign it to the "Must Use" box, and assign it a weight.  When you are done selecting your symptom, click on the Close button to go to the previous box and continue selecting symptoms, or the Done button to start on a new symptom phrase or to stop selecting symptoms.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another useful feature is the <a href="Questionnaire.htm">Questionnaire</a>.  As with the repertory-style search option, this feature is not required to complete your case, but can make it easier to track progress of your case and to select the initial group of symptoms.  Click the “Questionnaire” button above the Symptom List on the main form to bring up the first questionnaire page (Figure 2 is showing Page 7).  Fill in the patient information just as you would on a form when taking a case.  Use the “Continue” button and Page tabs to navigate between pages.  The first 4 pages are for individual symptoms, and the last 3 pages are for general information.  To add additional symptoms, use the “Add a Symptom” button on page 4.  You can then use the “Prev” and “Next” buttons to navigate between symptoms.  Use the File menu at the top of any of the questionnaire pages to save or retrieve your questionnaire to/from a file (this file is separate from a case file).  The “Print” menu allows you to print your completed questionnaire.  Click the “Find Symptoms” button at the bottom of page 7 to bring up a list of symptoms suggested by your answers in the questionnaire.  You can then use this list just like the Symptom List on the main form to select symptoms and assign symptom weights.  When you are done with the questionnaire, click the Cancel button on any page.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>Continuing on the Main Form, the “Must Use” button will copy a single highlighted symptom to the “Must Use” box at the upper right of the screen.  When prescribing, only remedies associated with this symptom will be considered.  The “Must Use” box can contain a maximum of one symptom.  Due to this fact, it will greatly limit your list of prescribed remedies.  It is not necessary to use the “Must Use” box for your case.

</p>

<p></p>

<p>Use the “Select” button to select the list of symptoms for your case.  When you click on this button, all highlighted symptoms (with the exception of the “Must Use” symptom and any previously-selected symptoms that may appear on the display) will be copied to the “Selected Symptoms” list on the right side of the screen.  Symptoms in this list are sorted in alphabetical order (ignoring the preceding weight number).  The number in the “Weight” drop-down will initially appear to the left of the symptom.  This is a weighting factor which you can assign (see below); these numbers range from 1 to 6.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>After you have selected a symptom for either the Must Use box or the
After you have selected a symptom for either the “Must Use” box or the “Selected Symptoms” list, you may decide to remove it from the list, perhaps because another symptom is more appropriate.  To remove a symptom from the “Must Use” box, click on the “Delete Must” button.  This will bring up a dialog which allows you to either move it to the “Selected Symptoms” list, or to un-select it.  To remove a symptom from the “Selected Symptoms” list, highlight the symptom (it may be necessary to scroll the list to bring the symptom into view), and click on the “Delete Sel” button.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>Symptom weights are used to improve the accuracy of the remedy prediction.  A symptom with a weight of 3 will count 3 times as much as a symptom with a weight of 1 when choosing a remedy, a weight of 6 will count twice as much as a 3, and so on.  One scheme of weights suggests assigning a strength of 1 to 3 to the symptom, with 1 being the weakest and 3 the strongest.  To this number, add 1 for specific physical symptoms, add 2 for general symptoms, or add 3 for mind symptoms.  As you become more experienced with Homeopathics, you may want to experiment with other weighting schemes.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>To change the weight of a symptom that is already selected, highlight the selected symptom in either the “Must Use” box or “Selected Symptoms” list, and select the desired weight in the “Weight” drop-down.  The number to the left of the highlighted symptom will change to that of the weight you select.  If you want to keep the original weight, you do not need to do anything.  Hint:  an easy way to choose weights is to select one symptom at a time, then select the desired “Weight” drop-down value while the symptom is still highlighted in the “Must Use” or “Selected Symptoms” box.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>You will probably want to save your case to disk for future reference.  To save a case, click on the <a href="FileMenuCommands.htm">“File”</a> item at the top of the screen (or hold down the <Alt> key and type an F), to pop-up the “File” menu.  This menu allows you to load and save files, print, and exit the program.  At any time, all available file options will show in black; unavailable options will be “grayed out”.  If you select “Save Case File”, your file will be saved by the name shown at the bar at the top of the window after the words "CASE FILE:".  If you want to choose your own file name (this is a good idea, as you will accumulate many cases over time), select the “Save Case File As” option.  This will bring up a dialog box which allows you to choose the disk, folder, and file name to save your case under.  Use the standard Windows file naming conventions.  The default extension is “.CSE”.  Once the file has been saved, you have a permanent copy of your case which you can refer to in the future.  To start a new case file, select “New Case File”.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>The “File” menu also contains print options.  For a full explanation of these options, see the detailed discussion for each item.  The “Print Preview” and “Print” options will preview / print your case Symptom List as it appears in the “Must Use” box and “Selected Symptoms” list.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>Once your symptoms are selected, you will want to consider a prescribing scheme for your symptoms.  The default scheme should be acceptable in most cases.  However, due to different needs and theories of Homeopathy, three schemes are provided.  See the discussion of the Main Form Optional Settings for a detailed description of the math used by the various prescribing schemes.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>To select a prescribing scheme, use the radio buttons in the “Prescribing Schemes” box.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>The “Default” scheme uses a weighted percentage; it takes into account that some symptoms are stronger indicators for a certain remedy than others.  This indicator is called the “remedy weight”; symptoms with stronger indicators have a “*” or “**” after them in the Symptom List.  The percentage of symptoms chosen for each remedy (out of the total number of symptoms given for that remedy), with the remedy weight and symptom weight taken into account, are used to determine the strength of indication for that remedy.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>The “Equal Weight” scheme is similar to the “Default” scheme, except that it doesn’t use the remedy weights.  Symptom weights are still used, and the indications are given as percentages of the total number of symptoms for each remedy, with the symptom weight factored in.

</p>

<p></p>

<p>The “Straight Count” scheme is a simple count of symptoms selected for each remedy.  As in the “Default” and “Equal Weight” schemes, symptom weights are factored in.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>In the three prescribing schemes, the percentages or counts for each individual symptom are multiplied by the symptom weight.  For this reason, if symptom weights other than “1” are used, the final number could be greater than 100 for the percentages, or greater than the number of symptoms for a remedy if the “Straight Count” method is used.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>Use the “Minimum Number” dropdown below the “Prescribe” button to select the minimum number of symptoms you must select from a given remedy for that remedy name to be displayed when you prescribe.  To select a number, click on it; the check mark indicates the selected number.  When you prescribe, depending on the scheme you use, you may find the list contains a large number of remedies, and that some of the remedies with higher percentage rankings have only one or two of your symptoms but generate a high ranking due to a small number of symptoms for that remedy.  This may be all right if the remedy contains key symptoms for your case; on the other hand, the remedy may not address several important symptoms, or there may be an excessive number of these “small Symptom List” remedies.  By using a minimum number of 2 or more, you can easily eliminate these remedies from the prescribe list.  When using the “Must Use” box, you will probably want to set the “Minimum Number” to 1; using a higher number may result in no remedies being selected for your case.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>After you have selected the symptoms and weights for your case and chosen the prescribing scheme, you are ready to begin prescribing remedies.  When you click the  “Prescribe” button, Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant searches its remedy table to find and rank remedies for your case.  The result is displayed in a pop-up list box, sorted with the highest-ranked remedy at the top.  The remedy names are listed in three forms on each line, separated by commas.  The first part, in CAPS, is the common abbreviation used for that remedy.  The second part is the Latin name, and the third is the English equivalent.  It may be necessary to scroll this list to see all the remedy names.  You can print just this list using its “Print” button, or print the list along with symptoms and optionally the Questionnaire using the Main Form File / Print menu option.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you want to investigate a particular remedy, you can double-click on the line which contains its name.  This will bring up another list box which contains a list of symptoms for that remedy.  This list also has a “Print” button, and can be scrolled.  When done viewing the remedy, click the “Done” button to remove the pop-up.  Similarly, click the “Done” button on the Prescribed Remedy list to remove that list.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>Another way to view a particular remedy Symptom List is through the “Remedies” button on the Main Form.  When you click this button, you bring up a list of remedies alphabetized by their Latin names.  Use this list to browse the remedy Symptom Lists for any remedy in the database.  To bring up the remedy Symptom List, scroll to the desired remedy, then either double-click on its line or single-click it to select it, then click on the “View Remedy” button.  To remove this pop-up, click on its “Done” button.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you want to take another case, you can remove your selected symptoms from the screen by selecting the “Close” option from the <a href="FileMenuCommands.htm">“File”</a> menu.  This will delete all symptoms from the “Must Use” box and “Selected Symptoms” list, and return the “Symptoms” list to the top.  Another way to do this is to select the “New” option from the “File” menu.  This will give you a default file name and prepare you for saving the file.  If you want to re-visit a case you have saved previously, select the “Open” option.  This will bring up a dialog which allows you to select a previously-saved case file.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>To make case taking simpler for future cases, you might want to generate a “core” case for each person you will be prescribing for, which you can use as a starting point for future symptoms for that person.  Besides illnesses, case “symptoms” can also be personality and physical traits, age, etc.  You may also want to add chronic symptoms to your “core” case files.  You will generally want to assign lower symptom weights to these traits.  Later, you can add to these Symptom Lists the symptoms for a particular illness, and use the “Save As” feature to save them under a symptom-specific name.  In general, you will want to give these added symptoms a higher weight.  Since in Homeopathy, a remedy which helps the flu for one person may not work on everyone, for example, doing this will make it easy to tailor remedies for each individual.

</p>

<p></p>

<p>Dr. Hahnemann’s Assistant includes several features which make the program easier to use.  These are “Key Accelerators”, the Toolbar, the Status Bar, ToolTips, and the Help menu (these should be familiar to Windows users).  The Key Accelerators provide a way to select menu items with a keystroke instead of using the mouse.  When a menu or selection contains an underlined letter, you can select that menu or selection by holding down the <ALT> key and typing the letter.  Another fast way to select menu items is with the <a href="Toolbar.htm">Toolbar</a>.  The Toolbar is the set of “Icons” which initially appears along the top of the screen, below the menu names.  These icons contain descriptive pictures of their actions; for example, the file folder with the arrow pointing clockwise brings up the File menu “Open” dialog, the icon of the printer will print your case Symptom List, and the blue button with the letters “Ex” will exit the program.  Icons which are “grayed out” are for options which are not currently available (for example, you can’t “Save” a file if no file is open).  If an icon appears “pushed in”, it indicates that item is selected.  See the detailed Toolbar discussion or the on-line Help for a description of each toolbar button.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>Other helpful features are the Status Bar and ToolTips.  The Status Bar is located at the bottom of the main screen and displays helpful messages as you drag the mouse cursor over various items (buttons, boxes, and lists) on the screen.  ToolTips contain the same messages, but they pop-up near the item you are pointing to after a short delay.  ToolTips are a good way to become familiar with the program.  As you gain experience, you may want to turn them off.  The Status Bar provides a less "intrusive" method to display tips.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>To turn the Toolbar or ToolTips off, click the “Options” menu, select the "Set Preferences" item, then click the “Show Toolbar”, "Show Status Bar", or “ToolTips” item.  You can also change fonts and font colors here.  When you are done, click the "Apply" button.
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="HelpMenuCommands.htm">Help menu</a> contains several features.  The first item, “Contents”, brings up a list of topics which you can view by double-clicking on the desired topic.  This entire instruction manual is available from this menu, as well as help on many Windows topics.  You also have the option to search for a topic and print a hard-copy of any topic.  For a detailed discussion on the Help feature, select the “Help” menu “Using Help” option.  For help on specific items on the screen, you can also click on that item and type the F1 key.
