<h1>Taking Cases </h1>
<p>In order to prescribe a Homeopathic remedy, it is necessary to gather as much information aboutmodalities (what makes the condition worse or better), and specific names of illnesses, if known.  This collected information is known as a "case".  In Homeopathic medicine, a remedy that cures one person's flu, for example, may not work for another person, due to differences in their characteristics.  For this reason, it is important to note as many distinguishing factors as possible to improve the accuracy of the prescribing process.  You may want to browse through the symptom list in Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant or a good Materia Medica to get a feel for the types of things to look for when making up your case.  Also note which symptoms appear stronger or more important.</p>

<p>You will also want to take note of the stage of the illness.  Many remedies are optimal for the beginning, middle, or end of a fever, for example; this means you may want to switch to different remedies as such an illness takes its course.  The notes in the Materia Medica can help you determine if you are dealing with an illness which requires switching remedies, and when you need to make the switch.  You will then want to revise your case and have Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant make another recommendation.

<p>You will note that many of the symptoms in the list are names of diseases.  You should use these only after being properly diagnosed by a trained professional.  Never assume you have the "flu" or a "cold", for example; it could be allergies.  Also, many diseases such as cancer, heart disease, etc. can be life-threatening.  Always seek the care of a qualified professional when dealing with these diseases.
