Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant is a comprehensive Homeopathic database program.  If you are new to Homeopathics, Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant provides a convenient way to explore this fascinating branch of medicine.  If you are an experienced practitioner, Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant will provide a quick and convenient way to research remedies.

Dr. Hahnemann's Assistant Version 3 is a Windows 10-based, specialized relational database containing a list of over 1200 Homeopathic remedies and over 20000 associated symptoms taken from several Materia Medica, including Dr. Boericke's.  It predicts remedies based on the group of symptoms you select, and on your choice of symptom weighting and prescribing algorithms.  A file utility allows you to save your symptom lists for future reference, and a click on a remedy in your list will bring up a list of symptoms as it would appear in a Materia Medica, for additional confirmation.  To aid in symptom selection, symptoms may be presented in several formats, including a questionnaire, a word search
grid results list, and a repertory-like series of lists.  In addition, the questionnaire module allows patients to enter their history on a home computer and e-mail it to the practitioner's computer; they can
then read it in to the questionnaire and generate an initial list of symptoms based on the responses.

A user's manual is included as a PDF file; the complete user's manual is also contained in the comprehensive set of Help screens and modules.  Printing is supported for the patient symptom and remedy symptom lists, the questionnaire, the prescribed remedy list, and the Help screens.  The prescribed remedy list may be exported into a spreadsheet-compatible file, which allows you to use your favorite spreadsheet program to produce graphs of the predicted "fits" of the remedies.
